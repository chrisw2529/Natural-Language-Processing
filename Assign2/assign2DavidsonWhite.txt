•
Find edit distance 1 corrections that are valid words
•
For each correction
–
  Determine the edit involved
–
    Compute the error model probability by:
–
      Finding the edit count in the confusion table
–
      Dividing this by undamaged character count from the 
      data
–
  Multiply by the frequency of the corrected word
•
Normalise so all probabilities add to 1


First, the candidates for the misspelled word, acress, are generated from a list of all known words one or
two edits away from acress. Then, for each candidate, determine what edit is necessary to correct the misspelled 
word. For example,  acress to actress requires inserting a 't' after the 'c' and before the 'r'.
