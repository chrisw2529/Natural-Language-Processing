  ~cmt~ Damn should have got a bunch of those instead /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ but they weren't breaking any rules! they're the only sub with rules! their 5042894 million viewers are 99% of reddit's traffic and ad revenue! reddit will die without them! reddit is targeting them unfairly!

  ~cmt~ B-but! he is a racist, a misogynist, a islamophobist, a homophobe, a warmongerer, xenophobic! he is not my president! /s.

Did I miss something? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ummm, you can't be racist to white people dickface /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The Clintons risked far more political capital for LGBT rights than Donald Trump ever has or ever will. They were the first family in the White House to support LGBT rights *at all*. Donald Trump risked nothing and probably influenced no one by expressing support for same-sex marriage a decade ago, when he wasn't running for anything. 

If Trump deserves a pass for his anti-gay rhetoric during the primaries because he had to win (e.g., stuff like wanting to appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn *Obergefell v. Hodges*), Clinton deserves a pass for stopping short of political suicide in her LGBT rights advocacy. If you actually read her leaked emails, you'll see that she still did work behind the scenes to help get state-level same-sex marriage legislation passed, even when it wasn't her official position. I mean, it's not quite on the level of progressiveness as holding a rainbow flag at a campaign event, or letting a gay billionaire say nice things about you in a convention speech, but it's close! /s

Well, at least Trump is filling the Executive Branch with LGBT icons like Mike Pence, Newt Gingrich, Chris Christie, Jeff Sessions, etc. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ah man, I was looking forward to more Ricky and Morty sauce jokes /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Fucking millenials. 

Edit: okay. This account has two comments. One is saying they don't get the Beatles reference and one comment is from two months ago with an Imagine lyric. I don't know what to believe anymore.  

Edit 2: /s is implied after "fucking millennials." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well, at least you're pretty    /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It can. 1lbm (pound-mass) exerts a force of 1lbf (pound-force) under earth's gravity. 1lbm=32.2slugs since gravity here is 32.2ft/s^2. If you just use plain "lb" then it can be referring to either one depending on the context. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Moved from the US to Germany for 6 month project with my job. I love making the joke that Im going to be twice as strong when I get back because Ive been working out with kilograms instead of pounds.

^(/s just in case it wasn't clear) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ha, as if a degree gets you a job these days.  /s  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You mean a bail out! The US government would never do that. It's not the American way. Plus there's no precedent for ever bailing out an entire industry. /s  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Maybe if you work 2 or 3 jobs in the food service/retail industry you can pay them off! Stop being so entitled! /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You can get a girl pregnant thru the backdoor? /s ~end~

  ~cmt~ What, you mean I need something as stupid and insignificant as *context* when I read?!? Nah, I'm just gonna avoid getting tattoos, never cut the hair on my temples, go kosher, mourn in sackcloth...

  ~cmt~ Yeah a massive upvote brigade... about a random joke... makes a lot of sense. People sure are committed these days. /s in all honesty I thought this joke was great. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Maybe we can employ their tactics with spiders to prevent school shooters from entering schools. /s
Honestly as a Floridian high schooler, a lot of changes are starting to appear (which are all long overdue), and I can say that I am personally starting to feel safer in school. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Turned out well i guess Ghost and infinite warfare are the greastest cod games to date! /s ~end~

  ~cmt~ Academia is controlled by jews trying to depopulate the earth and destroy the moral fabric of the United States come one pleeb. /s

Truly though, conspiracy theorists and their understanding of academia, the scientific method, and academic sources is the very definition of incompetence and delusion.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hey, as a tenured art history PhD professor teaching art history at the graduate level, I resent that! I mean, if I can't get paid to create overeducated baristas, then how else am I supposed to pay off MY student loans???

/s lol ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No I didn't /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Makes sense. Why just stop people form coming over, when we can also make them jealous of the greatness they see through border windows. ^^/s ~end~

  ~cmt~ I would believe you but you hesitated swearing and didn’t say cheers /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Putting in the "o" means eternity in hell.  Putting the dash means you're all good.  It's a legal loophole that G-d strictly enforces, obviously. /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No he didn’t just let it happen, he has a plan for everything. It all happens for a reason. /s ~end~

  ~cmt~ "If you can afford the cost of a president, you shouldn't have elected him in the first place..." 

/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Fact is, we need more people in the STEM fields and if we get more women interested, we can knock down our outrageous labor costs. 

/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You say /s, but it's actually true.  Corporate America was one of the biggest beneficiaries of women entering the workforce.  The supply of labor increased significnatly, but demand stayed the same.  You know what that does to wages.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Genuinely interested if it's /s or real? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > But that won't work because [women] do such a poor job.

Women, huh? Should just stay in the kitchen! /s ~end~

  ~cmt~ Ok... So what's funny about that? /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No, without the capital letter that doesn't denote a nationality. /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ soviet, I will edit in a /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Or you coyld, you know, use Cyrillic and save on a whole lotta ink /s   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What's the difference between the systematic slaughter of over 10,000,000 people and the accidental death of 1,500?

I wonder /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well the IRS is the only Gov agency that caught Al Capone and his Billions made during prohibition. Ironic that Capone died of untreated Syphilis(said to be from frequenting prostitutes) in a very "cushy" jail cell on Alcatraz Island.


The 'Mafia' has since took over writing policy while "hero" Elliot Ness died alone and in poverty after bringing Capone down. That alone should explain American Law and Government concern for it's employees and the amount of corruption present day looking out for the Nations best interests.


JFK, Marilyn Monroe. Bill Clinton, Monica Lewinski. Drumphh, Stormy Daniels and who knows who else has been Bill Cosbyed and paid to not tell..  IRS is all over it I'm sure! /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Is there a shorthand for non-sarcasm, like the opposite of /s? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ /s means end sarcasm right? So just put it at the start of what you're saying ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's actually .. Yes that would never get misinterpreted. /s ~end~

  ~cmt~ And what did you do for fun? ^^^/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So when she does it it's "not bad", but when I do it it's "inappropriate" and "sexual harassment" and I'm suddenly on a list.

These sexist double standards, I swear  ^^^^^/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ VRAM doesn't have to match the physical limitations of your stupid physical RAM pleb/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well, I could ejaculate like 3 times a day on average, let's say.  So then my steady state is about 127 GiB/s. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So when the cable company calls to sell me a better package I can now come back with, “150MB/s? Please, I can ejaculate more than that.” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Unfortunately Comcast has been throttling my penis to 10 MB/s..... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Never saw this before... /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No.  It's only if you buy a high-end APPLE cell phone.

Paying $950 for a Samsung is smart

Paying $1000 for an iPhone is stupid

  ~cmt~ No, that phone is ANDROID which makes it okay. ^^/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It would've been funny if the earth wasn't flat 

edit: apparently an /s is very much needed for this shitty joke
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Worst part about  /s is you remove the best part of sarcasm.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This begs the question if a sphere is technically infinitely flat on the surface, then was he right about it in the first place?^^^^/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hahah funny joke, but seriously the Earth is flat

Edit: ffs do I need to put /s after everything? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ There has got to be a better way to make it obvious it's satirical than putting /s after it. Imo the /s kinda ruins jokes ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Your tone of voice doesn't translate into text which means that we have to guess if you're being sarcastic or not. So yes, you do need to put /s after everything. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So you're saying Hitler did nothing wrong? Reported.

/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why does no one respect the /s? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The /s is respected by me.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I was fuckin' with you. You saw the /s right? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wrong, it's when some one has the ability to read a person's face like a book, obviously. You need to get out more./s ~end~

Am Dutch, I don't think condesending is the right word. Generally we are very egalitarian but also quite direct in giving our opinion. ~end~
