~cmt~ Tell that to the four men she married. It's too late for any of those poor souls. ~end~
  ~cmt~ They could form a barbershop quartet and sing a song called "I Want My Dick Back, Kim." ~end~
  ~cmt~ All shotgun weddings, but they also eloped every time. hmmm. ~end~
  ~cmt~ It's the no-contraception, conservative Christian way. ~end~
  ~cmt~ I dunno about that. To me, she's the ultimate contraceptive. Whenever I get an inappropriate boner, I close my eyes and whisper Kim Davis Kim Davis Kim Davis, and just like that it's gone. ~end~
  ~cmt~ Maybe she sucks a mean dick ~end~
  ~cmt~ That’s not what makes shotgun weddings... ~end~
  ~cmt~ Well, she sucks, she's mean, and she's a dick. Close enough! ~end~
  ~cmt~ She is strictly against allowing men to hold dicks, so she probably won’t hand them back. ~end~
  ~cmt~ This is what I don't get.  She's married 4 times and somehow 'the gays' are violating the sanctity of marriage. ~end~
  ~cmt~ Some people like to point out that she married before she converted to Christanity. What they fail to mention is she converted from being Baptist to Apostolic Pentecostalism.  ~end~
  ~cmt~ I read that as Apoplectic Pentahole ~end~
  ~cmt~ If you convert the pentahole correctly, it can only be apoplectic  ~end~
  ~cmt~ I think she married one of them twice... ~end~
  ~cmt~ For the sake of humanity I hope they didn't breed.  ~end~
  ~cmt~ Oh, they did. Her marriages and divorces and kids were so complicated, someone made a flow chart. ~end~
  ~cmt~ Thats what I call an "info-tragic" ~end~
  ~cmt~ Less of a love triangle and more of a love dodecahedron  ~end~
  ~cmt~ Were cousins involved?  ~end~
  ~cmt~ Hopefully she don't flow no more and won't clutter Kentucky with the litter of her womb. ~end~
  ~cmt~ Ah and these are the people protecting the "sanctity" of marriage. ~end~
  ~cmt~ You can't make a claim like that without a link! ~end~
  ~cmt~ Three men. Married one, cheated on him with #2, cheated on him with #1/#3, now on #3/#4. My memory of this might be slightly off but it's 3 men, 4 marriages. BUT MUH SANCTITY OF MARRIAGE ~end~
  ~cmt~ 3, one of them did it twice! ~end~
