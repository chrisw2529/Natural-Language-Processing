~cmt~ Well ya see, Hillary didn't mean to share classified info but she did, which reveals incompetence. Trump *meant* to share classified info, which shows real boldness.

  ~cmt~ Don’t forget, he’s a Marxist to! /s ~end~
  ~cmt~ Dude, don't you know those are the fuckin' lizard people? Can't trust a word they say. I like my news full of typos and wild conjecture. I want my news to read like my Facebook timeline. /s ~end~
  ~cmt~ Its so sad that we really do need '/s' after comments like that now, considering what the internet has become ~end~
  ~cmt~ But open markets will just work themselves out /s ~end~
  ~cmt~ But to the mass majority of ~~dumbasses~~ people out there, only government dictators censor us; not good hard working American corporations. Surely the almighty hand of unregulated capitalism will only bring in things pure and good /s ~end~
  ~cmt~ Fake news! it was mutual sex with a 14yo from Tinder. Does it matter? Would you rather have a *librul* in that position?

Wait no...turns out that Orangutans are Subfamily Ponginae, Chimps are Panina.

Well... **THANKS** for making me *Learn* today! /s

  ~cmt~ Both parties are the same! Lots of very bad people on both sides! /s ~end~
  ~cmt~ At least y'all didn't vote for the neoliberal corporate shill /s ~end~
  ~cmt~ Exactly! This is just like having a document about a person, it includes pictures of the person but with blurred face. But you also step provided with the date of birth, place of enployement, bank account numbers, ss number and address. Oh but you don't get the persons name nor face.... right, I won't know who this person is... /s ~end~
  ~cmt~ Of course they read! They read the Bible. /s ~end~
  ~cmt~ Don't let that distract you from the fact both parties are the same!  So says the internet.  /s ~end~
  ~cmt~ > So says the internet. /s

There is a deafening chorus of BothSidesism on Reddit and social media generally every election season.  ~end~
  ~cmt~ See? Both sides are the same /s ~end~

Both parties are same. We need to overthrow all politicians that don't match up exactly with my thinking, because otherwise, there is no use supporting someone that matches with me only 60-70-80%.

  ~cmt~ Obama's press sessions were always such a clusterfuck, normal folks just couldnt understand what the hell was that mooslem talkin about. Now this is a president who brought in the order and rule everywhere and finally one that speaks like a true honest blue collar man.

  ~cmt~ How can global warming be real with all these snowflakes in DC? Checkmate, liberals. /s ~end~
  ~cmt~ no he doesn't, his kids own all his companies now so there is zero conflict of interest there. /s ~end~

  ~cmt~ Well it's less polluting than it used to be. And all the regulations and improvements they were forced to make? Paid for by the users, not the stockholders.

I pay $10/month in clean coal fees on my bill - that's often almost half as much as my actual electricity usage.

I look forward to next month when the white smoke coming out of the coal plant down the river turns black again and kids start dying... again! /s ~end~
  ~cmt~ We are going to reduce the likelihood of nuclear war by starting another nuclear arms race. /s ~end~
  ~cmt~ More global warming means Carrier sells more AC checkm8!  /s
 ~end~
  ~cmt~ But he went on about how we will be at the cutting edge of energy in his speech!

I really don't get how one can be against investing in clean energy. It's jobs, cheaper energy, less brutal labor, less impact to the environment. It's a win/win.

But, I suppose there are some countries that rely on oil and natural gas as their primary source of GDP. I wonder if there is one such country that has been involved in this election /s.  ~end~
  ~cmt~ But both parties are the same! /s ~end~
  ~cmt~ But guys Hillary is just as bad, voting for Jill Stein is the way to help the environment.

  ~cmt~ oh that place that we sent a batch of toilet paper and water bottles as relief? that's a part of the US?? /s ~end~
  ~cmt~ Hmm. Personal responsibility? Decentralized economics? Why would a conservative party want that?? /s ~end~
  ~cmt~ Why would you want to avoid it?  It's a simple solution to global warming! /s ~end~
  ~cmt~ What a radical stance! /s ~end~

  ~cmt~ JUST WAIT ONE GOSH DARN MINUTE!  The Republican's came out and said just a couple days ago that their investigation cleared the Trump camp of all wrongdoing!  This is obviously a FBI witchhunt!

  ~cmt~ It was Bill Clinton era even, which is when we gave 400 billion in tax breaks to ISPs which they literally did nothing with. We were supposed to have 90% internet coverage in the US by 2006, with an an average speed of 40mb/s.

ISP failed miserably on both counts, and made record profits every year doing it. We still haven't hit those numbers. ~end~

  ~cmt~ No, no, not a stupid liberal IQ test. The test will take place at Trump University. /s ~end~
  ~cmt~ But you see Donald Trump, the three time wedded man, who talks about groping women, who mocks people including the disabled, who has associates accused of working with a foreign adversary, is a rich white man,

Barack Obama is black. He should be held to a higher standard.

  ~cmt~ You mean the "failing" NYT and WaPo. Didn't you get the talking points from state media? /s ~end~
  ~cmt~ But who leaked the memo? That's the real crime here.

Yeah. I couldn’t say that with a straight face.  ~end~
  ~cmt~ Where did you get your Helsinki info from? CNN? MSNBC? NYT, WP? All fake news. More Dem lies. The Dems and deep state edited in lines to make dear leader look bad. Don’t believe anything you see or hear unless it is from an official govt entity or media source.
