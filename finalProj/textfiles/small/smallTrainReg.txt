~cmt~ Were cousins involved?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hopefully she don't flow no more and won't clutter Kentucky with the litter of her womb. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ah and these are the people protecting the "sanctity" of marriage. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You can't make a claim like that without a link! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Three men. Married one, cheated on him with #2, cheated on him with #1/#3, now on #3/#4. My memory of this might be slightly off but it's 3 men, 4 marriages. BUT MUH SANCTITY OF MARRIAGE ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ 3, one of them did it twice! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "I wouldn't fuck her with a stolen dick!"

--George Carlin ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I WOULDN'T FUCK'ER WITH MY OWN ASS!!

--Tourette's Guy ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Not even with Trump's dick  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ \*mushroom.

FTFY. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Toad did nothing wrong! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Nice job, Cohen! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No. Fuck that bitch. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I will not! 
Good job Kentucky! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yeah, fuck fucking her.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ - her last THREE ex-husbands.

Sanctity of marriage. Am I right? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm so happy right now. Didn't she loose to someone she tried to deny the right to marry? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yes!

Sorry: apparently that candidate lost his primary. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ewww ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ They still gave us McTurtle ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ We have two more years. I'm looking forward to hearing who they pull for the Democrats to run against old Lettucehead. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm hoping its not Grimes again. She'd be fine, but I think we need someone new to have a chance at beating McConnell. Too many Kentuckians already hate her ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wait until 2020... Alison Lundergan-Grimes was running a close campaign in 2014 until the "war on coal" shit and painting her as a Clinton ally. This next election will be about Trump, and turtleman is going down! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I can only get so erect. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ She was the clerk in one county. Good job Rowan County. The rest of the state did nothing. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ One district looking Blue, the McGrath/Barr race over much of what is 'civilization' for Kentucky is tight but closing soon. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm replying to myself, but Kentucky news is calling it for Barr.  

It was really close, but that was the best chance for Democrats to get a foothold in Kentucky, with a good Democrat candidate.  You can't take all those university cities, with the college kids, the education levels, the decent living and the I-75 connection as a Democrat, you got zip for foothold in that state.

That was the one district Democrats really had a good chance on taking away from Republicans, and looks like it went Republican.

What can you do?  Shrug.  Welcome to dry county territory. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I really thought McGrath was going to win, tonight. Hopefully, in two years the candidate that faces that Trump bootlicker will have learned from Barrs negative bullshit. When a candidate's campaign is built upon mudslinging and lies, you can't play nice and not respond. It just doesn't work. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Who's better than McGrath, next?  I thought she was appealing enough to the undecided, the moderate and the conservative Dem as a military combat veteran and down-to-earthy to carry this time. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ She is appealing; she damn near won!  Her speech tonight almost sounding like she isn't done with politics, so maybe she will try again.

Anyway, by 2020, the Meuller report will be out, and I suspect that it will contain damning allegations against this White House, so 2020 will be about Trump and those that support him, and I doubt that the bootlicker son of a bitch that won tonight will distance himself from Trump, so, he will suffer his fate, too. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ We got much more work to do in the district, to carry her through next time, for sure.

Time to shrug this one off, watch the rest of the races, it's late enough to crack open a beer, and probably test how my VERY MAGA parents are taking news of McGrath falling like they wanted.

If we have the House, we got a foothold on tomorrow, at least. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That's the spirit! This district has bounced back and forth for years... our day is coming, again. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > This district has bounced back and forth for years

True.

At least we live somewhere where the fight is interesting and matters.
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Lexington/Fayette went 60/40 for McGrath but outside of Lexington the district is still deep red.  I'm surprised it was as close as it was to be honest.  Madison county went 60/40 for Barr.  The Problem with Madison is outside of EKU and Berea college students and faculty it is as red as the rest of the district and most of the students are registered in their home counties or states if they are registered at all.  Also I don't think we should underestimate the effect of Trump having a rally at EKU a few weeks ago.  It helped get his base to actually show up and hold off McGrath.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Not surprised Madison County went red, just disappointed.  I checked demographics two weeks ago, and it was 94% White.

I haunt around the Madison County area, and for as good as it seems on the surface, it is MAGA, too-white and rich enough underneath it to lose it to the Republicans, like you said.

I shouldn't be surprised, though.  I've heard people talk in the city.  And I know signage shouldn't be an indicator, but McGrath was nearly lost in the sea of Barr political signs out on the main roads and Main streets. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Am from Rowan County. Getting rid of Kim Davis is nice, but still sucks with how conservative my district is.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yeah, but Andy Barr was re-elected.  I tried, I really did.  :( ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This one hurts... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'll admit, I'm a tad demoralized.  But I'm still the same person before this candidate came along.  I have the same political views before and after Amy McGrath.  We just have to keep plugging along and things WILL change.

I was a young man once and we all chanted revolution.  But the truth is, everything takes time.  It sucks having to wait, but nothing worth having is ever easy.  Take gay marriage as one example.  That didn't happen overnight.  It was all baby steps.

We'll get this country where it needs to be eventually.  We just have to keep fighting.  I'm just hoping it doesn't take something really bad happening to make people see it. 

[Late night edit]:  Apparently the Democrats have control of the House.  So all is not lost.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well said, we will keep fighting.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ womp womp

enjoy that wingnut welfare you crispy old garbage monster ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Unfortunately, this will just lead to her making big bucks going around the country talking to "religious" groups about how she was SO FUCKING PERSECUTED because she was a Christian who valued "God's law" over "man's law". ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's not that we reached that point, we were always there, but now every psychotic "persecuted" Christian has social media. 


I don't hate Christians, but I dispise these assholes.  ~end~
