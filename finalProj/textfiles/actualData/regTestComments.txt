Two things:

1.) Typical Republican is more worried about their misdeeds being reported than they are upset over their actions to begin with. It's this mindset of "I wouldn't be such a bad guy if the machines today didn't report fake news!" 

It's a complete lack of understanding the basics of technology and refusing to even learn the bare minimum.

2.) If the phone indeed was a hand me down majority of the time ads are targeted based on the user's activity on the phone including websites visited, location, and so forth. If you're 7 year granddaughter is seeing unflattering ads about you in a F2P game then perhaps you need to question who was using the phone before and what they were using it for. 

But it's nice that they had a hearing like this so we can confirm just now stupid some of our representatives are... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I wish our country wasn't run by geriatric morons. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ These people do not understand the questions that they are asking... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Is there a single entity, anywhere on Earth, who Republicans don't claim to be a victim of? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is our (Iowas) rep. Holy shit that's embarrassing. These guys make decisions?? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm a Google AdWords certified contractor and I can put ads on iPhones and Androids through Google's system. Soooo this seems overblown. 

But on another note, if Stephen king doesn't want to be presented as a racist, than he should be less racist.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ To which Steve King replied angrily, shouting at the chamber... "GET OFF MY LAWN!" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Can we please start shaming those in the political sector who are technologically inept? The people running our states shouldn’t be so incompetent that they can’t use google to find out who makes the iPhone prior to a hearing. It’s ridiculous.

Also fuck you Steve King, you fuckin racist ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ These politicians are so out of touch with today's technology landscape and privacy issues. IMHO, the whole Gov't needs to be replaced by younger people in their 30s/40s, who can pass a basic tech aptitude test along with their ivy league J.Ds. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Is there video of this?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Steve King is an embarrassment and embodies so much of what is wrong about our government. Old people are great, one day I hope to be one, but these old men and women in their 60s+ in Congress don't know a damn thing about modern technology as evident by this joke of a representative. This was the same case during the Facebook hearing and it was just as embarrassing the dumb questions they'd ask. King literally asked him a question my 80 year old aunt would ask me. He's the guy that calls every gaming system a Nintendo. Yet he's up there questioning Google.

Also...

>Democrats erupt into laughter

I don't know about everyone else but I didn't hear any laughter at all although it definitely warranted this horrible human being getting laughed at. Maybe the mics just didn't pick it up. ~end~

  ~cmt~ I'm confused. Most apps (even on iPhones) use Google AdSense, right? So if an ad pops up, surely it IS related to Google.

Now, of course, the question is still stupid. "How does an Ad like that show up on an 8-year-old's phone" doesn't even make sense. But I feel like the answer isn't great either. ~end~

  ~cmt~ This is the TEA, every Retail job I’ve ever worked or any job that entails dealing with customers, Usually the uneducated Republican type (I mean cmon you can just tell) blame you for their issues. For example, I was a pharmacy Tech at Walgreens and every time there was an insurance issue due to the fact of the doctors office OR it wasn’t apart of their formulary they would immediately blame me or my pharmacist OR the pharmacy as a whole.. probably because it doesn’t take a lot of thought to throw blame out into the world when it’s convenient for them. ~end~

  ~cmt~ This shouldn’t be the story. The much more important story is the one the NYT broke on Monday regarding privacy. But it’s a non-partisan issue so it won’t get as much traction here.

>	Republican and Democratic lawmakers focused on whether Google tracks a user’s location without obtaining consent. Some cited an article by The New York Times, published on Monday, that showed how easily supposedly anonymous information can be linked to a person.

>	The sharpest exchange involved Representative Ted Poe, Republican of Texas, who held up his smartphone and asked Mr. Pichai whether Google was tracking his whereabouts if he walked to the other side of the room.

>	”Not by default,” Mr. Pichai said, meaning it depended on the settings on the apps that Mr. Poe had installed on the phone.

>	When Mr. Pichai wouldn’t respond with a definitive yes or no, Mr. Poe raised his voice and interrupted.

>	“You make $100 million a year. You should be able to answer that question,” he said. “I’m shocked you don’t know. I think Google obviously does.” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Republicans are fucking scum. I am so tired of beating around the bush with this. This has been beaten into the ground for 2+ years on this website but bear with me: if Obama had done an iota of what Trump has done, Republicans nationwide would be out on the streets in force imposing martial law and burning the fucking world to the ground. We all know it. They all know it.

I mean seriously, can you even imagine what the reaction would have been

 • if it had been revealed that Obama cheated on his third wife with a pornstar while said wife was pregnant with his son, and then used campaign funds to buy the pornstar's silence because she may influence the outcome of the election if she spoke up?

 • if Obama had had private meetings with Vladimir Putin wherein not a soul knew what was spoken of, and then in front of the entire world Obama claimed that he believed the leader of a hostile foreign nation over his own intelligence agencies?

 • if Obama had admitted that he set up and had knowledge of a meeting with representatives of hostile foreign nation to get dirt on a political opponent?

 • if Obama had openly admitted to obstructing justice in an interview on fucking national news and then later tried to claim it was somehow fake?

 • if Obama had said "take the guns first, due process second"?

 • if Obama had "joked around" about being President for life?

 • if in 2010 it had been revealed that Obama had lied over 5,000 times in under two years since taking office?

 • if Obama had said that not clapping for him is "un-American and treasonous"?

 • if Obama had hired members of his own family to serve in his administraton?

Republicans are fucking scum. They're hypocrites of the highest order. I am so sick of these old hyperpartisan fucks and their horde of willfully ignorant Neanderthal followers. The world will be a better place when they're gone.

This man controls most of people's online lives through search, navigation, mobile OS, advertisement, and youtube.  They know everything about people and this is what is being asked of them.  They have troves of data and are being told to accept that they won't leak it that it's secure or anonymized and not to worry. 


They kill off almost any company that steps into their domain with crazy monopolistic moves, or they buy them out after stifling them.  But that's ok, they are innovators, they bring jobs to the US.  They abuse H1-B visas like no ones business.  And they don't pay fucking taxes.

  ~cmt~ How the fuck are we ever going to successfully regulate these companies if regulators don't even know the difference in the devices they own? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It’s really fucking scary we are in 2018 and the current lawmakers of both political parties are living in 1975.  We really need to clean house and get younger so that we don’t fuck future generations.  The laws of the future are going to start to be determined today. There’s no excuse for you to not understand intellectual and technology laws if you’re the ones being asked to write them.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ “Look, I’m a racist but I don’t want my granddaughter to know I’m racist” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Holy shit, they get time with the CEO of Google and proceed to ask him for free technical support.  These people need to be voted the fuck out of congress. Clearly, they're ignoring the concerns of their constituants and need to be removed.  Don't even try to tell me that these idiots never get thousands of mails about privacy, security and planned obsolescence, which apparently they ignore.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ whoever voted for this guy, you guys are all idiots. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "And no, Mr King, cassette tape players cannot read your iPhone ... Yes I believe you when you say it fits in there." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ These guys are fucking idiots.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is what happens when the only thing your resume states as job experience is "cross burning". ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I’m not a big fan of Google nor the US government but those google folks sure did make the politicians look stupid and slow, how can we get people with the intelligence and leadership that run companies like google into the public sector? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ OMFG, can we just ask Alexandra Octasio Cortex to give a Phone/Social Network/Internet class for dummy? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Can you imagine the reaction if Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez did this? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Between this and the shit show with Trump, Pelosi, and Schumer today, I'd be embarrassed to call myself a Republican. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ \*White supremacist Steve King  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If King is upset that his granddaughter is seeing news that he's an ass, maybe he should stop being an ass. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Asking the CEO of Google to help you with your danged phone.

Grampa level: Congressional. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The voters of Iowa’s 4th district are, for the most part, dumbasses.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why does a 7 year old have their own iphone or android phone? There's an issue that can be fixed for your granddaughter. You don't want her to see that kind of content? DON'T LET HER HAVE A PHONE. Give her a coloring book for Christ's sake.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This asshole doesn't realize that the results he sees are personally tailored to his searches and browsing habits, and he keeps blaming others for his own illiteracy. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Out of touch old trashbags ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Christ these people are so out of touch with the modern world. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The same way that those Congressmen had a female lawyer question Ford to hide how sexist they are, why don't they get tech specialists or academia question these tech CEOs to hide how tech illiterate they are? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Which phone is made by white people? Because, obviously, that's the one I have." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I like that The Hill isn't pulling any punches with this clown.  They don't say "alleged" ties to white nationalists.  Just that he had them.  Which he undoubtedly did of course, but the media always loves to just couch their language so as to not offend the easily offended idiots. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I would ask how stupid you can get but look at this administration day by day ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This reminds of the time the British Prime minister demanded Google remove all the child porn from the internet.  

Apparently The Google is in charge of all technology everywhere. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ They just proved Facebook is biased and congress didnt do shit to them. Starting to think they are trying real hard to make google a scapegoat instead of what really happened. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ “But think of the white children!” - Rep. Steve King.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well at least he's not the nation's IT consultant to the President of the United States, who thinks a mistyped hyperlink is a conspiracy to manipulate their Twitter account. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Can our government officials do some fucking research and prepare educated questions when they try to question some of the world's smartest tech leaders? It's embarrassing to watch. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ explaining computers and the internet to grandpa ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Unfortunate that congress full of lawmakers who haven't the faintest idea of how modern society and technology work. Tough questions should be asked of Google (concerning their business in China, data collection practices, how they use location data), and I don't think any member was able to ask those questions. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's always bothered me that we have science and technology committees being run by people who really know nothing about either. Yet they'll sit there and determine among themselves that 90+ percent of the scientific community has no idea what they're talking about. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The highlight of my day so far is watching a bunch of old guys try to figure out how a complex, multi billion dollar tech company works ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He probably calls all smartphones iPhones. It's just like my parents calling every video game console made after 1986 a Nintendo. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ We need to elect younger, more technology literate people... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I’m glad those in charge of policy have no fucking idea what’s going on.  ~end~

  ~cmt~ In other news, water is wet, sunburns hurt, and cats continue to be just adorable.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The problem is that they have turned the Republican party into our largest criminal organization to do so. So now it not only only protects the wealthiest, it constantly abuses everyone else, with low pay, no health care, poor education and no security and they are about to kill the very concept of, hope.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Much of our political system is built that way, such as campaign funding, media conglomerations, and lobbying. We shouldn't pretend this is just a Republican issue. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ But let's be honest, mostly billionaires. Small business owners often take the brunt of Republican economic policy because it's really meant to benefit large companies/donors.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The Republican Party is a P.R. firm for special interests. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Don't forget Racists and the hyper-Religious.

It's the 3 R's of Republicanism: Rich, Racist, Religious. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It always has. A co worker of mine who is several years older than me told me that his grandfather told him that unless he is rich he has absolutely no business voting Republican...ever.

They may have changed on social and identity politics since the turn of the 20th century but they have always been about business and trying to convince the little man of pulling yourself up by your boot straps when we all know everyone, everywhere gets some form of help from someone or the government. I hate that bs self made trope.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well no shit.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is very true, but it's also true of the establishment Democratic party (excepting populists like AOC and Bernie). The entire power structure of our country exists to protect the upper class. I hope people realize this if we ever get to a point where we're trying to change things for the better, and not just resisting the worst of the worst of GOP policies ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ 95% of politicians exist to protect the Capitalist class. The 5% that don't are crucified in a media who's discourse is controlled by large corporations through advertising.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The Green($) Speakers  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The GOP is the political arm of the 1%. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ ... by using tribalism and rhetoric to fool the less educated Americans to vote for them. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Let's be fair--the Democratic Party also exists to protect millionaires and billionaires, they just go about it in a more sustainable and less ghoulish way. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The old Republican party has given itself to Trump and no longer cares about morals or family values, it's only goal is to make rich people richer now. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ GOP is like the aristocracy of old, except with a lot less class and a lot more idiocy. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Fueled by their bribes. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Finally the TRUTH about the most dangerous threat to America , the GOP. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And to con enough poor white people into believing that they represent their values and whiteness. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The Republican party exists to keep the voters from knowing which millionaires own the politicians they voted for. Voters don't even know the nationalities of the people and companies that own the politicians they voted for. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I heard this in Bernie Sanders' voice. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ the GOP itself is basically an astroturfing operation by the rich. they gaslight the public and wedge them on one or two key issues and keep them on their side.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It becomes more obvious with each passing year but those of us who've been paying attention have known this fact for decades. Neoliberals who kowtow to the wealthy elite populate the upper ranks of all major parties across the developed world but unlike the Republicans, most (not all) parties still have values and lines they won't cross. 

Neoliberalism is a disease and the Republican Party is its worst symptom.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Rural America sees themselves as millionaires in waiting because being poor in the US is a sin. We value money over social well-being. The gop is just exploiting that to protect their big money donors.  ~end~

FIXED. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ protect? protect from what exactly?

more like “enrich” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ AKA today’s version of Slave owning plantation owners. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Nothing wrong with protecting millionaires, there's a lot of them.  A million dollars is really only like 3-4 houses these days ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It’s sad how many working class religious/conservative people just wont see this because the Republican Party pretends to care about their “values.” Never seen a group more martialized to vote against their own interests. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Looks like the best option is to work hard to become a millionaire because the republicans keep winning.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wow so all those CEO's who own 90% of the mainstream media love Trump too? I never knew CNN loved Trump.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Can't argue with that headline.  Thanks to the digital age they are being exposed like they've never been exposed before.  Frankly, they don't fully understand how accessible tech and big data combined with investigative journalism is fucking up their agenda to keep things quiet (see Steve King and Guiliani). ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Didn’t see that coming  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The biggest trick the GOP millionaires and billionaires ever pulled was convincing their base that they are one of them. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Not a republican or democrat, but don't act like the democrats care about the poor.  If I recall correctly, it was Democrats who decided that if people couldn't afford health insurance, they should be forced to pay a fine as punishment.  (before anyone says it, I'm not a republican or a trump supporter either, just tired of people acting like Democrat=good).   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And.., whom do you think the democratic party exists for?  CLEARLY the RP is more extreme, but the DP is far from pristine too.  IMO, both parties are a disgrace and generally dysfunctional.   That said, the RP is WAY WAY worse. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Obv ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ At the expense of everyone else.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Our entire sociopolitical system has been harnessed for that purpose, I would argue.  


If you think that somehow the democrats are beholden to a different group of people, think again.   Or think in the first place.

  ~cmt~ "Racists, bigots, and anodyne-sounding "social conservatives" have no inherent interest in kleptocracy, and vice versa. But the need to cobble together a coalition capable of winning elections has compelled the fiscal conservative establishment to make those groups' pet issues into key components of its political platform."

This is the key to frustration to both self-interested and altruistic Democrats and Independents.  

Republicans have used propaganda to whip part of their constituency into crazed kamikaze voters who will vote against their own financial interests, even against healthcare for them and their family, and most frighteningly, against saving the earth from destruction brought about by climate change.  All to benefit rich strangers. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ In other news, water declared wet!  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > The fact that a minority of Americans favor this fundamentally unjust arrangement is what drives literally everything the modern Republican Party does. Racists, bigots, and anodyne-sounding "social conservatives" have no inherent interest in kleptocracy, and vice versa. But the need to cobble together a coalition capable of winning elections has compelled the fiscal conservative establishment to make those groups' pet issues into key components of its political platform.

This is the hardest thing to grasp.  By all accounts, the racists and bigots are awful people...but they'll still happily go along with the program of voting against their own financial/medical/overall self-interests, just so that they cheer about "their team owning the libs." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And the average people who support them are gullible enough to believe that they will someday be part of that club. They won’t. They’re voting against their own interests and are too ignorant to realize it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Duh. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Dems too; [here's an article about how Obama helped billionaire bankers while leaving average Americans holding the bill](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/01/12/democrats-cant-win-until-they-recognize-how-bad-obamas-financial-policies-were/)

if you don't think Democrats are doing just as much protectionism of millionaires and billionaires as Republicans, you haven't been paying attention to who their donors are. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Government in general exists to protect the rich.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Both parties are there to protect the rich one just does it more cut throat then the other. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So does the Democratic party

&#x200B; ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And has since at least Reagan, if not LBJ. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ While I agree that the GOP protects the rich. Wasn't it Obama that let the bankers off scot free after the housing bubble collapsed?

Let be a bit more honest they both protect the rich.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Doesn't matter since they have a significant portion of their base that votes purely to spite Liberals.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ True. But also the Dems. Didn't Obama bail out wall Street? Didn't Clinton pass NAFTA Dems are trash. Republicans are the dumpster. America deserves better. ~end~

Now you're reporting the obvious.  Thanks media.  I mean, it's about 5 years too late, but hey, we'll take it.  Next you'll start sticking to your guns and actually go for that answer to the question trump just passes over.  See... you're getting it.  It's call journalism.  Say it with me.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Let's take it one step further. 

*The Republican Party Exists to Fuck Over Non-Millionaires and Non-Billionaires.*

anyone who hasn't figured this out since the early 80s , well....  I don't know what to say.  Better late than never I guess! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No shit. I cant understand how anyone could ever be a Republican. They are 95% of the time on the wrong side of history. Also the Republicans that ended up doing good, are nothing like the current party at all. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Duh  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ okay i understand that the republican party is a shitshow and a fake front for protecting the wealthy but can we please post shit that we don’t already know??? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ /r/NoShitSherlock  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wow someone finally said it. They also combine as many strong stances as possible to stay relevant such as anti-prochoice, pro first amendment, prison happy crime reform and some idea that jesus is the only choice for America. Its like, lets make a dime from the big spenders and fool as many emotionally overwhelmed voters to stay relevant + the ol gerrymandering while we destroy the environment and dont even pretend we care about the deficit. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ There is only ever one war, and that is the rich against the poor. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Someone on reddit told me I was ignorant for saying "Republicans care more about rich people" though. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And by extension your job, retirement, generally cushy lifestyle, and everything you take for granted. Something something about the hand that feeds you. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The entire US government exists to protect Millionares and Billionaires. 

If welfare was to stop, the police to lose funding, banks and businesses their favorable tax incentives and massive government support its the wealthy who are going to get the worst of it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ All parties exist to protect millionaires and billionaires.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The Democrats do to, just to a slightly lesser extent. That's why we need Bernie.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And water is wet ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Racists, sexists, Religious fanatics ... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I thought it was black people that didn't know what they were voting for and satisfied with crumbs for their easily bought Democratic votes ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Protect!? They exist to enrich the rich. Fuck you peasants!😂 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No it exists to protect capitalism ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And they're doing an outstanding job of it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That's what the whole USG has been about for two and a half centuries. Revolutionary War (economic freedom from England), slavery, United Fruit Company, CIA coups, anti-communism (protecting markets), wars for oil, corporate lobbying, dark money. You can draw a straight line through all of these. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That picture is so awkward.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Oh is America just now realizing this. 

Here's a thought folks. If you're 30 and you still haven't made your billions, then I'm sorry, but it's probably not going to happen. 

So quit voting against your, and by extension my and everyone elses, best interest. Thanks in advance.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The republican party freed the slaves. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Then why do a very large amount of the the rich vote democrat?  Literally almost every major city in America voted democrat in 2016. If this statement was true, the rich would all vote republican, which they clearly don’t.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And also Donald Trump. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I think it is clear its for racism more than money.

Not one or the other, but racism and corruption seem to trump money.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You mean millionaires and billionaires like Bill and Hill Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, Chucky Schumer, and Jeff Bezos? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Citizens United apparently ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You don't say? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No fucking shit, sherlock ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ They rent the Democrats when necessary. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ ... also the sky is blue. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And to be fair: From this point of view, they are doing a tremendous job. Imagine to make ~100 Mio. people believe that giving to the rich people and holding back any progress, even proven good, is good for them. No one in history was able to convince so many people to vote against their own interests. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ (so does the Democratic party) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ As if our last President didn't protect Wall Street after they knowingly destroyed the economy. You guys are so fake. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Nah, it's not even 1-10 million millionaires,  it is beyond that. If they cared about low level millionaires they would not have gotten rid of SALT. Those that live in wealthy states that have an expensive home or a 401k, the doctor, lawyer, mid level manager, they have more in common with the guy making 45k than the one making a million or more a year. Let's not kid ourselves, this is just to protect the UHNW. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If you think you have to be one one side or the other, you are part of the problem. Do what most conservative people do. Mind your own and be nice.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Both parties serve that purpose, but the Republican Party is certainly much, much worse and tends to do very little else. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Protect" is the wrong word.  The wealthy can afford and have ways of getting their own protection.  The Republican Party exists to make the rich and powerful even more rich and powerful through the slow but steady extraction of wealth and power from the poor and powerless. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yet everyone believes every word of Jeff Bezos's WaPo propaganda paper. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This has been the platform of the (farther than centrist) Left since I can remember in the 70s.

&#x200B;

Back then one needed to read things like "2600", or obscure political rags to read this opinion.

&#x200B;

now EVEN GQ WRITES ABOUT IT and yet the GOP double down.

&#x200B;

&#x200B; ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ As does the Democratic Party.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I read this as millennials and billionaires, and was like what? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well, duh.... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ GQ? lol...  Just a friendly reminder, only 1% of businesses are owned by these billionaires. The rest are owned by your average middle-class citizen just trying to survive.  
  
Why do you think that actual mega corporations vote democratic and small business owners vote republican?  Once you are on the top you don't want to be challenged therefore you vote for heavy taxes and regulations; because a bigger corporation can survive this when the smaller ones can't.

But the real evil is not capitalism or socialism.  The left and right can see eye to eye on many things.  They learn from each other and advance their political stance.  The problem is corporatism; this is when big companies are in bed with the government.  No company is too big to fail, America's biggest banks collapsed, but they were bailed out by a democratic government. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So does corporate democrates ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's a dirty job, BUT... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ How many times can a rebublican president spend like a drunken sailor, put America in financial peril while doing nothing for it's neediest?  All they have to do is scare the dumbest, most hate filled with fake outrages and voila!  Power. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well, yes and no. I mean, I feel like this is the natural progression of things similar to the idea that it's a 2 party system.

Republicans represent the status quo and/or what the status quo should be. If everyone was middle to upper class, then healthcare would be affordable and retirement would be possible and the world would be a pretty good place. Actually, both sides want this, but come from fundamentally different backgrounds. Democrats want to accomplish this by bringing everyone up, while Republicans want everyone to bring themselves up.

Since the Republican viewpoint is that people should fund themselves, it's natural that this leads them to benefitting themselves. Since the Republican party receives so many donations and whatnot, these people are part of the elite and wealthy that are benefiting from their own policies. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why are so "many random things in" quotation marks? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ My co-worker about 4 hours ago: "I hate Unions, but I love our Union because it helps us"  (is a Republican).. we are a Union Job....


 I wish I was joking, but I heard this today.

He is also wealthy via marriage and wall street".




 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yes the Republicans and all their Trump boot licking are terrible, but the democrats aren't much better. We need better representatives. Currently politicians represent corporation's, and not their constituents. We have to change this, they will not change without our pressure.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Let’s be fair: so does the current Democratic Party. However, it looks like it’s only the Democrats who have any hope of flushing out enough of the rot, and get some fresh blood that can lead to some real justice for everyday Americans. The Republicans are beyond a lost cause for anything other than societal poison.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pretty sure the two parties exist in opposition to each other to support social interventionism but restrict runaway centralized control.... if you want to cast one party or the other as being fundamentally evil from its inception (as you shouldn't). id go with the party of slavery. (and no they didn't switch) ~end~

> Other than &quot;Downplaying federal crimes committed by the president,&quot; the modern Republican Party cherishes nothing more than finding innovative ways to lighten the financial burdens of the millionaires and billionaires who support it.

> Investigations of nonfilers-people who skip submitting their returns altogether-have plummeted, from 2.4 million in 2011 to just 362,000 last year, and untold billions of dollars in uncollected tax debts expire each year after the ten-year statue of limitations runs its course.

> For Republicans, these strategic omissions are as important to their constituencies as the affirmative act of passing the tax reform bill.

  ~cmt~ so do the democrats ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And so do many Democratic politicians. It's more of a "the elite class of millionaires and billionaires exists to protect millionaires and billionaires." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ But Chapo says both sides are just as bad, and I only let podcasts do my thinking for me now. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ True, but let's not kid ourselves and pretend that it isn't a big part of the Democratic party's raison d'etre. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You mean both parties right?   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This headline is of course factual but it's important that we recognize this is something the Democrats are guilty of as well. Both parties serve the elite and we deserve better representatives.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hate to say it, but both parties have their fair share of corruption, and popular democratic states tend to have advantages in place for corporations or foreign investors which can lead to problems like gentrification.

The ones I dislike the most are posers like Pablo Escobar who are into politics for money or were brought into it by bribes in order to create a new law/policy which would benefit whoever is offering the bribe. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ As do teh Democrats, though the GOP are far worse.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I suppose all those Democratic congressman millionaires are in it for the poor? C’mon people, let’s not act like both sides aren’t bought and paid for:

Republicans are just outright with their intentions to send money to the already rich, but Democrats do it politely.  Doesn't make it any less bad. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ While I do agree with this title, the exact same thing can be said about corporate Democrats. And it is the corporate Democrats who control the party as a whole.

We badly need a 3rd party. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ unlike the Democratic Party, which is notorious for how harshly it persecuted millionaires and billionaires under the leadership of its last two presidents ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ To be fair, so does the Democratic party. They’re just more quiet about it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It’s not exclusive to republicans.

  ~cmt~ *Nancy Pelosi on why the Trump meeting was private: "We didn't want to say, in front of those people, 'You don't know what you're talking about'."*


Nancy dropping bombs today. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm hoping he'll have an "evidence based conversation" very soon in court. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ PELOSI:
>We have to have an evidence-based conversation about what does work, what money has been spent and how effective it is.

Amen. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Note that Trump cannot handle confrontation, which is why he is always willing to do whatever the last person who spoke to him suggested, why he can't fire people in person, and why Pelosi is mopping the floor with him. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Oof. That's a long wait for a train that don't come. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is why Pelosi is Speaker ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Nancy Pelosi hits a 3-run shot into the upper deck!   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ She might as well challenge a fish to climb a tree.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ As soon as he heard the word "evidence" his 80 year old sphincter puckered right up.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That won't happen because Trump lives in a non-fact based reality ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Oh, 2019 is going to be so glorious. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Nancy and Chuck wrecked him in this meeting. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pelosi was glorious.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Previous Donald Trump (and Pence): We catch 10 terrorists a day at the border.

Today Donald Trump: We've caught 10 terrorists at the border this year.


Almost like he makes this stuff up.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump: I AM THE EVIDENCE!  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Republicans voted for Trump because they were sick and tired of evidence-based decision making.  That's why I implore them to ignore the advice of their physicians.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Can we start calling Trump a Nancy boy? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That's rude of Nancy. It's like expecting a 2nd grader to pass Calculus. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Whoever did this deserves a good star:  https://twitter.com/SaysHummingbird/status/1072598448589946880?s=09 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I look forward to having a President Pelosi once Trump and Pence will be forced to resign or be impeached.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I haven't seen any evidence that Trump is capable of engaging in evidence-based anything ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Logic and evidence is a liberal conspiracy." Trump Supporters ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That was simply the best thing i've heard a Democratic politician say in a long time. We have strayed so far from evidence-based policy in since the conception of right wing media that I don't know how we can find our way back. "Evidence-based conversation" doesn't sound sexy, but it needs to be on the tongue of every Democratic politician.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ At the same meeting Trump threatened to use the military to shut down the government if he doesn't get his wall. Watch him say it [HERE](https://youtu.be/AZtCfBR8ZZQ?t=14m43s).

 "You wanna know something?...You know what I'll say? Yes: if we don't get what we want one way the other whether it's through you [Democrats], through our military, anything you wanna call, I will shut down the government."

The seizure of a state by the military is a coup d'etat. CNN just published an article [HERE](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/11/politics/donald-trump-nancy-pelosi-chuck-schumer/index.html) that includes the quote above, but the headline is "The reality TV president just got beat at his own game" with no observation of the alarming (to put it mildly) threat by POTUS.

I think this warrants more attention. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hard to have an Evidence-Based Conversation with someone who doesn't know the meaning of Evidence-Based.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wit?!  Evidence?  My gut is filled with evidence  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump doesn't believe in expertise. Good luck with that.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I legitimately think he is psychologically incapable of that. I think his definitions of facts, truth, and evidence are so warped that you could offer him a trillion dollars and absolving of all his, his friends', and his family's crimes, and he would still fuck it up. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump and his Cult don't care about facts or evidence ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He's gotta be doubly pissed that she's stealing headlines from him. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Woah, woah. An evidence-based conversation? That seems like a bit of a leap, doesn't it?  


Let's start with finger-painting - between the lines - and go from there.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Does "many people are saying" count as evidence? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The amount of projection from Republicans is always funny. They accuse democrats of making arguments based on feelings yet have little to know reason to believe what most of them believe. There must be a lot of cognitive dissonance and self-loathing going on there ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ When have Republicans ever been interested in an evidence based conversation on *any* topic?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pelosi should challenge Trump to have a brain based conversation  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pro-tip to Mike Pence: wear a yellow suit if you are sitting down, Navy Blue to hide in the drapes. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He's got the most evidencedest you can get... it's like a smocking covfefe. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ facts would put Trump into a brain melt. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ When I broached the subject of Trump’s many moral failings, bankruptcies, affairs, lawsuits and apparent collusion with a foreign power to subvert democracy with a life-long friend from my freshman year in college (35 years ago), he said, “Well, Hillary...”

I immediately interrupted him and told him that I wasn’t asking about Hillary. It doesn’t matter what she did or said or didn’t do. She is not the President. I said, “I’m genuinely interested to hear what you think about Trump, not Hillary.” 

He didn’t have a clear answer, but he admitted he didn’t like his “style”. 

I am so glad I got the hell out of Iowa, left the Republican Party and started thinking for myself.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He’ll just bring alternative facts.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I mean.... isn't that about the same as asking him for a Unicorn for your birthday?

I just isn't. Fucking. Happening. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump, without evidence... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The evidence would say that state department programs (shuttered under Trump) that supported local efforts to create jobs and provide safety for the populations of central and south America were more effective deterrents than any domestic wall.

&#x200B;

Of course, Trump would never admit that, because he doesn't admit mistakes, nor does he understand nuance. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ maybe give him something he has some chance of succeeding at? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is the moment in any movie, where the protagonists ask the typically lied-to question, and hit record unbeknownst to the villains.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ See that's just not going to work.  All the evidence we have indicates Trump is incapable of having an evidence-based conversation, therefore anyone hoping to have one with him is ignoring evidence from the get-go. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Looking forward to Trumps tweets about this.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > woman invites pigeon to game of chess

... What the fuck is she doing? That man is physically incapable of having an evidence based conversation.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That's what I would say if I wanted to keep a meeting with Mr Smocking Gun brief. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ She got jokes. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pelosi challenges the wind to stand still.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Man, I like "evidence based conversation" as a succinct rhetorical retort to "fake news" and a few other bullshit Trumpisms.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is what i voted for. Proceed, Democratic leadership. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'd settle for reality based
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ She was masterful, today.

&#x200B;

The concise, practical definition of "PWNT." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Evidence based conversation with Trump is like asking a building to move. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ funny how Drumpf's promise to make Mexico pay for it is totally out of the picture now and no one brings it up ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is a glimpse of what the next two years are going to be like. It is telling when the "greatest deal maker" gets his ass handed back like this.

Side topic: I gotta go slow on this popcorn... Empty calories ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pelosi 2019 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Just watched his argument with pelosi in the White House.   He won't have to shut down the government because he won't be in the White House ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Evidence and the republican party mix as well as oil and water  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Come on, Nancy, you know Resident Bone Spurs is too much of a coward to debate anyone, especially a woman. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That orange coward will never face off with Pelosi again. Today was glorious and should have happened a long time ago. If he avoids impeachment they’re going to humiliate him like this the rest of the term. Can’t wait to see him storm off camera next time. Crying probably.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Followed by trump asking what the word evidence means.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I would like to see somebody have a non-evidence-based conversation with Trump where they make big whopper lies with a straight face. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That's Tariff Man's kryptonite. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wait, That's asking him to do the impossible. we can't have that... he'd have to stick to facts and actually not lie. I don't think Trump can put together more than three sentences without lying.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Beliefs are all that matter lol 

I believe in this and don’t believe in that. I don’t want to hear your facts. Its all just fake news! 

Pretty much if rich aren’t getting richer, minorities and the poor aren’t oppressed and “Christians” aren’t getting their way, then they don’t want to hear about it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He spouts out cherry picked facts about illegal crossings being down 90%+ in various areas where there is a wall that has been built (or renovated? It wasn't entirely clear), which may or may not be true. But either way it's completely and utterly useless without comparing how illegal crossings have changed in other places along the border where there isn't a wall. If illegal crossings are just down across the board then it's nothing to do with the wall. If there's a noticeable difference between where there's a wall and where there's not a wall then it's maybe something to look into.

But just spouting "crossings are down at the wall" in isolation is completely fucking useless as reasoning to do anything. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump: Evidence, like when I have to go to court after my impeachment? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Holy smokes!  He already lost! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Okay but how about *Alternative* Evidence? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm sure once Trump looks up the definitions of "Evidence" and "Conversation", he'll get right on that. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Oof. That's just about impossible with *any* Republican or Republican-voter these days, thanks to Fox News, et al.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That's like challenging an infant to a fistfight. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Go Nancy! Someone needs to call him on his hyperbole and bullshit!  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Did anyone else first read this as “Pepsi challenges...” ? Still made perfect sense to me. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Evidence? That's fake news! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This little “scene” was very troubling. This is exactly how reality tv is produced. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I could have a political debate with my dog in the morning when I let her outside and I’d get the same result. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ how about starting simple, with a "thinking-based conversation" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's going to be a lot of fun to see Pelosi troll Trump these next two years. It's so easy to get under Trump's thin skin and get him to say something ridiculous. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I think he still has bone spurs... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The next presidential debates should simply include 5th grade math story problems.
  
"Mr president: if McDonalds is 3.7 miles away and the max speed your motorcade can drive is 24 miles per hour..." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So what was this conversation about today? Why were Schumer and Pelosi talking to him for the first time ? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ But how will you ever drain the swamp? Darnit, 9 more days for cakeday. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It'd be the first time in his life. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yes. Let's talk campaign contributions. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The only word he’d understand from that is ‘based’ and it means something different to what he thinks ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Fact is that this is political theater.  Both candidates were FOR a Wall/barrier.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlFi0QUboxs

So instead of fighting for a living wage, or to get out of the wars, or for Healthcare or education.  The establishment Dems are gonna pretend that their own platform didn't include a wall/Barrier.  To avoid fighting for the workers.  LAME. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wait, why discuss evidence based solutions when you can just say "excuse me, 👌EXCUSE ME 🤚Nancy 👐we need border security.👌" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Checkmate Pelosi, Trump has a natural instinct and doesn’t need your “evidence-based” facts.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I think he should have an “evidence-based conversation” with Mueller. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Baby boy was purple ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You might as well challenge a golden retriever to a tennis match. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Checkmate! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I was banned from r/conservatives for posting this exact comment

“Yeah there’s a lot of space in there”, in response to a comment “I can’t imagine what’s going on in Trump’s head”. What a bunch of fucking pussies. They are an exact mirror of everything Trump.  No outside thoughts, news, or opinions welcome. I’m posting this in every thread, to inform people what a joke these people and their subreddit is.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I think what is the most important with what she was talking about, was that she wanted it in private.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ For some reason...Hillary never did the same. The lead up to 2016 was pathetic. No real dialogue at all — just bitching and moaning and attacks on respective character. McCain/Romney may have lost...but we all lost out in 2016 to the stuff that elections are about: spirited, intellectual, and fact-based dialogue. Obama had it. The Hillary campaign did not. And it all boils down to Trump...and his inability to articulate and inspire. Both are required of the job. Therefore, Trump is not qualified for the job. Yet, Hillary et al. had to share the stage with this fraudster...

Hold his feet to the fire and articulate what we know to be true. Trump is a rabid and traitorous idiot who inspires the same. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I hope that will be a different conversation to the manhood conversation.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Totally  funded the wall. Thank you! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ [removed] ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ “Lol fuck you Nancy Pel-lose-i”

How do Dems still have no idea how to handle this stuff. The right wing does not care about civility or truth and pretending that they do is a hobble. Dems are trying to play fair in a game without rules.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Unfortunately, there's evidence and there is the left wing narrative of evidence. One will get you places. The other will not. Guess which one Pelosi wants to hear? I have no real hope for the future of this nation anymore, honestly.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ [deleted] ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That's hilarious Nancy ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Evidence like.... Democrats wanting a wall just 10 years ago? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Then she went on to make emotion based arguments.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mY7yX0MnTEA ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ But really guys, keep going on about how Chuck and Nancy need to go. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ ELI5 what Schumer meant by that? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ FUCKINGGGG FINALLY three goddamn years waiting for ANYONE to call this orange turd on his bullshit, can't believe it was ol Chuck to serve him up like that ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pelosi gets a lot of criticism, but the way she handled this meeting was pure professionalism.  Schumer, who I like, came across as just trying to score points, while Pelosi comes off as a principled, rational, and focused on the common good.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He has a very good point there. There were ten states that Trump won in 2016 with democratic incumbents. In the end they only won four, not even half. And a lot of these states where won by pretty big margins. There was one state that Clinton barely carried with a republican incumbent and democrats won two seats. Everyone is obsessed with a majority, but the truth is that the senate is so heavily rigged in the favor of republicans that 53 seats is actually quite pathetic. Having a supermajority should be piece of cake for them given the map. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Did Mike Pence speak in this meeting? At all? I haven’t seen one quote from him in anything I’ve read. Why was he even there? He doesn’t even have anything to do with this. Ryan and McConnel should’ve been in that room. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'll have whatever Pence took before this meeting.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I was hitting my knees from laughing when Shumer did that burn and than he that grin from ear to ear on his face. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pence looks like he has one of those remote control butt plugs cranked up to 11 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pence made Disney animatronics look like olympians.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'll be the first to admit that I'm not crazy or Chuck or Nancy but this was a perfect showing.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The portrait of George Washington contributed more to the discussion than Pence.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It’s impressive that he still manages to daily squeeze out what little integrity was left from the toothpaste tube of the United States Presidency. 
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The intellectual giant of the GOP strutting his stuff ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Shutting down the government to pay for a border wall is like unlocking your doors, & turning off your security system, just to go build a fence around your property with workers you can't pay. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Okay I like Schumer even more now.

This should become a regular thing. Shitting on Trump while in front of him is oddly satisfying.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ There was a time when Republicans were obsessed with tearing down a wall. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ As a fellow New Yorker with a dry sense of humor, I agree with Schumer here.

As a bleeding heart Democrat that thinks we need to campaign everywhere no matter if we win there or not, I disagree with Schumer here.

Either way, Trump is the one who should be the most worried about what he's said here. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If you ask me Trump called this meeting so as to extend an olive branch because he feels the walls closing in. This was an act of desperation... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I thought it was an interesting show of transparency! 

You don’t often get to see old politicians bicker about national issues, and you can tell this was incredibly impromptu by the body language of Schumer and Pelosi. Humanizing. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pelosi: " We didn’t come here to divide. We came here to unify ." 

Can we knock it off with the unification crap? I'm not interested in trying to reach some common ground with the stark raving idiots running the Republican party.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ As someone who grew up in North Dakota, I'm glad I'm off Facebook and not seeing the North Dakota reaction. They tend to turn any attention up to level 11. Josh Duhamel is a really big deal. A Democrat belittling North Dakota is the ultimate hate porn, they'll talk about it for the next two years.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And *this* is why the Democrats always lose...:

> Pelosi told reporters that she did not want the discussion to be on-camera out of respect for the president.  "I didn’t want to in front of those people say, ‘You don’t know what you’re talking about,’” she explained.   

They have an openly corrupt president (who stole an election and does illegal things every single day) - and the Dems are afraid to tell Trump he doesn't know what he's talking about.  They won't call him a liar.  They won't fight back at all.  They just sit back and let the Republicans get away with all their cheating and lies.

Remember the election when Trump was calling all the Democrats criminals and threatening to put them in jail???  Yet, they're afraid to even call him out on his lies.  It's shameful.  The Dems need to grow a backbone for once. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ bigly brain at work ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump is a moron ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Is this the great dealmaker at work? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wait another year and then ask the farm states if they like Trump’s trade war. ~end~

Pelosi countered: “Mr. President, you have the White House, you have the Senate and you have the House of Representatives,” she said. “The fact is, you do not have the votes in the House."

>Pelosi asked that the meeting, which she said was headed in a “downward spiral,” to be taken off-camera multiple times, but the president refused. In a post-meeting news conference, Pelosi told reporters that she did not want the discussion to be on-camera out of respect for the president.

>"I didn’t want to in front of those people say, ‘You don’t know what you’re talking about,’” she explained.

  ~cmt~ Ft. Collins Colorado is apparently trying something similar. They're spending 142 million dollars to bring community owned fiber optic internet to the town which should be operational in 2019. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Does anyone know where to start to get this done for your own town? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Awesome. We have municipal fiber in my town. 300Mbps Up/Down, $40/month. Had maybe one outage in 3 years. Comcast would go out of business if they tried that.

Edit: Updated speeds for accuracy. I could upgrade my connection for an additional $20/Month and be awarded with a full 1,000Mbps Up/Down here in my town. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is how you avoid Comcast. 
They're a government sponsored monopoly, put in place by the elected city councils. 

The way to change the cable provider in your area is to attend council meetings and voice your opinion when they take a vote to establish a franchise or to provide an extension for a franchise agreement.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Comcast was also given the boot in Tucumcari, NM earlier this year. It's now being run by a local company that's running fiber to every home in the city.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Obligatory: Fuck Comcast ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So when can we expect Comcast to begin the carpet bombings? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ An increase in property taxes would cover the construction cost. But the town would also bring in revenue from selling broadband service and potentially break even, making the project less expensive than Comcast's offer.

"With 59 percent of households taking broadband service, the tax hike would be 29 cents [per $1,000 of assessed home value], similar to that for Comcast," a Recorder article last month said. "But if 72 percent or more of households subscribe to the municipal-owned network, there is no tax impact, because subscriber fees would pay for it." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is promising! Every time I hear a story about a small town setting up municipal fiber of some sort, however, I then hear about telecom companies going to the courts to try to stop them, with mixed results:

* [Comcast sued a city trying to build high-speed internet — then offered its own version](https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/1/8530403/chattanooga-comcast-fcc-high-speed-internet-gigabit) (tl;dr: Comcast sued town trying to put in its own fiber, lost, and then was forced to offer their own fiber offering, which is a good thing.)
* [Cities, FCC Lose Fight to Expand High-Speed Internet](http://fortune.com/2016/08/10/municipal-internet/) (tl;dr: Appeals court sided with telecom companies / states in opposition to the FCC and local governments to set up municipal broadband. The telecoms argued that taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for broadband and the telecom companies shouldn't have to compete with the government. The ruling noted that the Chattanooga Fiber network forced Comcast to lower rates and stopped Time Warner Cable from increasing rates.)

And when they don't take the town to court, they lobby hard to get the state to pass laws that basically outlaw municipal broadband or puts a barrier of entry so high that it would be almost bankrupt the town from even trying:

[Municipal Broadband Is Roadblocked or Outlawed in 20 States](https://broadbandnow.com/report/municipal-broadband-roadblocks/)

>These state laws — which range from **outright prohibition** to **outlandish bureaucratic circus hoops** — are largely developed under pressure from telecom corporations. These companies spend tens of millions lobbying on Capitol Hill each year, and hundreds of thousands running anti-municipal-network ads in local communities. Lobbyist spending from major telecoms was in excess of $11 Million in Q1 of 2017 alone. 

It's absurd that telecoms fight tooth and nail to prevent the people from having cheap, reliable access to broadband, but then fail to provide a cheap, reliable access to broadband after they get their way. They want the status quo, a monopoly over the market and no incentive to compete or innovate. As shown by Chattanooga Fiber, when telecoms are forced to compete, prices drop as consumers have more and better options.

If the telecoms spent a fraction of the money that they put into lobbying / suing into providing a decent network, perhaps people wouldn't beg for municipal fiber to begin with. In the case of Charlemont, however, at least Comcast made an offer and put it to vote, and here's hoping that they respect the wishes of the people and not try to sue / lobby for a state law to block this effort. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If municipal fiber can break even in a community as thinly populated as this one, it can make it anywhere.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >"The Comcast proposal would have saved the town about $1 million, but it would not be a town-owned broadband network," the Greenfield Recorder reported Friday. "The defeated measure means that Charlemont will likely go forward with a $1.4 million municipal town network, as was approved by annual town meeting voters in 2015."

My deepest congratulations to the folks of Charlemont.  It may seem like you are going to have to spend $1million extra. But you will save a billion on bs charges, shitty predatory service, wasted time and productivity spent on arguing with customer care and generally worrying about those fucking data caps. 
I wish you all the best and I hope your story inspires my shitty town. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ha, fuck you comcast. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's incredibly reassuring to know that this can even happen! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ All utilities should be in the public sector, including anything in the telecommunications sphere. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Municipal fiber answers to community, not share holders, that's a very big difference. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm sure the "states rights" republicans will do everything they can to shut this down.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ We have recently started investigating this in my community (where I am an elected official).  We are a smaller town and not on the top of the priority list for our current data provider options in terms of upgrading to higher bandwidth / more reliable service.

&#x200B;

We started out by joining the Community Broadband Action Network  [http://broadbandaction.com/](http://broadbandaction.com/)

&#x200B;

We designated one of our City Council members to join in with this group and they attended a seminar that was being held nearby to learn more.  This was a very useful first step, in that we got a good overview of the process and what our options were.

&#x200B;

I am sure I am overlooking details, but here's the high points of what we found out:

* There are many forms that community broadband can take.
   * You can set up your own municipal broadband utility, and operate it the same as you would your water plant or road dept or any other public service.  This is probably the most up front expense, you will have to pay for design of your network, and issue bonds for its installation.  However, if you have something like 2/3 of your residents sign up, then this can be a long-term self sufficient option.
   * A second option would be to go in with other nearby communities to set up a broadband entity, or buy into an existing one.  this would follow the same model as the telephone "cooperatives" that serve many rural areas.
   * A third option would be to contract with a third party for-profit telecom company (fiber based broadband companies are popping up like weeds the last couple of years)  to construct and operate a broadband utility.  This has higher end user costs, but is sort of a "no muss no fuss" way to get fiber in your town.  The downside is, unless you are very near to an existing trunk line, or you are in a larger community, these fiber provider startups are probably not going to be too interested, you're not going to be as profitable.
* You will need to assess the desire and projected number of residents that would be willing to sign up - that public outreach effort will help you determine which option you might want to take and whether it is even feasible.
* I'm not sure if this applies to all states, but in my location, we will have to pass a referendum at the next general election to enable the City to form a broadband utility.  This does not commit you to actually taking this project on, but you have to have it in place before you can legally start contracting for design, construction, bonding, and so on.

&#x200B;

Our community decided the third party provider was the most attractive since we just did not have the personnel available to help with administering a whole new utility.  We had public meetings to assess the level of interest, and sent questionnaires to residents.  We started contacting vendors, but miraculously, about the same time, our two existing broadband providers became EXTREMELY interested in upgrading their network in town.  Funny, what a coincidence.  So where we are right now is waiting to see what sort of service they are offering and what the price point will be.

&#x200B;

In my fairly rural state, as of 3 months ago, we had something like 12 to 15 individual independent municipal broadband communities.  They ranged from maybe 1,500 people on the small end, up to 40,000 on the high end.  The typical size range for a municipal broadband community was around 15,000 people. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Tomorrow’s headline: State senate passes law banning municipal internet (totally not connected to Comcast thing, we swear.) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Good!  The homegrown Telecom in my town decided sold and the town got to vote who thinks sell it to and the legislatures ignored it and sold it to a big ISP from some other state.

We also gave Comcast millions to improve the infrastructure and 7-8 years later they still have done nothing and argued that they didn't need to. ~end~

  ~cmt~ smart people. Can we do this everywhere please? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ My city has municipal fiber and it is the fucking best. I can't even remember when the last outage was. I would almost dare to say close to 0 downtime. Even when there are outages due to installation or upgrade there are calls made to inform you and let you know the duration of the outage.   


When on comcast outages and problems were plenty.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Comcast can't even deliver high speed internet to all of Philadelphia - a metropolitan area and where their national headquarters is.

http://www2.philly.com/news/comcast-digital-internet-access-philly-poor-people-20181210.html

>Across the United States in 2017, the national broadband penetration rate by household was 83.5 percent in 2017. And in the Philadelphia suburbs, including South Jersey, it was 88.1 percent.

>**In Philadelphia, the rate was 71.6 percent, the second-lowest among the 25 largest cities.**

>Philadelphia (WHERE COMCAST IS HEADQUARTERED) was the only large city to record **a decline in internet access**, the Inquirer’s analysis found. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Internet is becoming more and more of a basic nessescity in modern society. It SHOULD have municipal options. ~end~

This is my city, and we didn't just try it...we did it. More cities need to use the approach to take down big comm. Our service is incredible and we can have up to 10 Gig to the house.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ We have municipal fiber here in Longmont, CO. It is gigabit fiber in both directions. Very low latency, excellent service, and i pay $50/mo.

It does not require any tax subsidies or anything, it is self sustaining. They tore up our streets to route the fibers to each neighborhood in phases and everything, but it pays for itself with just $50/mo.

Please, contact your city’s leaders, and tell them you want municipal internet service! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ There was a measure introduced into the city counsel of my city to hire a consultant to investigate the feasibility of a municipal broadband rollout. 
 
The sanctioned ISP in the area is Cox. They bought a counselmember.
 
Said counselmember is named Lauren Kuby. She insisted that fiber is so last century that it wasnt even funny and that the city already saturates their own fiber network.
 
She did not disclose that the fiber network in question uses 1990s era 10/100 meg hardware or that the fiber network is used only for the traffic lights and there is no way to saturate even a single strand fiber at 100 meg. 

When called on these points she doubled down on the supposed obsolescence of fiber and insisted that wireless was only a few years away and we should all wait for that instead. 
 
Her own figures estimated that it would cost 65 million dollars to roll fiber to every address, which she said was exorbitant. 
 
This is for a city of 185 thousand permanent residents and home to one of the largest college campuses in the world. Paying that bill in 5 years would be an easy matter of $70 per permanent resident per year. Paying it in 10 years would be trivial.
 
Fuck you Lauren Kuby, you corrupt shitbird. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yeah, that sounds great, but all it really means is that Comcast goes and steamrolls the state legislature into prohibiting municipal telecom networks, as they and Verizon have already done in other states. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Does Municipal Fiber sound like a laxative to anyone? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Is there a way I can try to make this happen in my area? I've lived in the suburbs around Pittsburgh my whole life and I'd like to do my part to try to make something like this happen here. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Good for them. The next town over from me has municipal fiber that gets bundled in with the rest of their utilities (also municipal). Speeds are higher, service is better, costs are lower... I'm jealous.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yeah, comcast is spending a shit ton of money to create commercial ads to fight it too. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Fuck Comcast :D ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Regardless of political leanings, I think most Americans can be brought closer together with their shared hatred of Comcast. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ My town has municipal internet (Shrewsbury, MA) and Comcast is trying to make inroads here. I hope my town responds negatively to Comcast's survey and tells them to fuck off ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Can we do that too?" -every American not employed by Comcast. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Sign me up please!!!! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Chattanoogan here! EPB is amazing! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ My hometown worked with Ting to do the same thing, wire every home in the city (about 19k people); love alternatives to Comcast, and the more I see yard signs with each house showing they will have 1000 up/1000 down for 60 bucks, no hidden details, the more Comcast has been shown to be the exploitative soulless cash whore its always been... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Here's a map of similar projects across the United States:

[Community Networks](https://muninetworks.org/communitymap) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ * Be vigilant people. Many states have laws preventing this.

More than 20 states have laws on the books preventing local communities from building municipal fiber networks—the FCC recently said it would help local communities preempt those laws, giving power back to small towns who know what they want better than anyone in the statehouse.

But the Rep. Marsha Blackburn's amendment, which nearly all House Republicans voted in favor of, would make the FCC's move illegal.

https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vvb3yb/house-republicans-are-killing-the-dream-of-local-high-speed-fiber-internet

  ~cmt~ Nationalize it ~end~

  ~cmt~ The internet is a utility.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I live in a small Co town that did a fiber deal two years ago. It’s amazing. Way better service than Comcast at a much better price. So glad we did this.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ My town just got municipal fiber, paying $75 for 1000 up and down. I really hope I never have to go back to a private ISP again. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ They are correct in doing that.

- they cost $50,000 a mile to run new cable
- you don't want to be doubling up infrastructure resources

It would be like Union Pacific running a separate set of railroad tracks next to Amtrak lines. It is an extraordinary really stupid waste of economic resources.

also they should not build their infrastructure or people are going to not use it. they cost $50,000 in mile to run new infrastructure, you want it and put that money where it can do the most good.

if a municipality is going to be running their own fiber, then we will spend our money on some place that is underserved. 

We should put the resources where it is needed, not where it is not needed. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ coming very very soon:
“Comcast lobbyists start massive campaign for state ban on municipal broadband in Massachusetts” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Some things shouldn't be profit based, internet access being one of them.  It's as vital as electricity or water services and should made available without profiting from it's consumption.

  ~cmt~ Fuck Comcast! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Break up Comcast.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I lIve in Washington state where we still have net neutrality, unfortunately I have the option of Comcast and a really shitty century Link service.. That's IT.  Raising prices for no reason and data caps, hooray. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Don’t worry. There will be legislation passed I’m sure that makes anything other than Comcast illegal. It’s happened before... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Next in line, Comcast pays off the state politicians to prohibit municipal fiber in the state. It's happened elsewhere.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Nice. Fuck Comcast. Hope to see more of this ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I would love to see small towns leapfrog big cities in accessible technology due to big companies caring less about the small populations! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Good for them! Fuck Comcast up the ass sideways with a pineapple. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ As someone who just moved in to a new apartment in small town Sweden, municipal broadband is just awesome. Just connect your laptop to the outlet, go to the municipal broadband website, choose the vendor, fill an online form and that's it! I have around 15 vendors to choose from, most of them without any binding period of more than a month. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What are the privacy/aspects concerns to a government run internet service? 

Will they be required to receive a warrant before handing over all of your internet activity to the police/prosecutors? 

Or can they just play the same game Facebook and others use of, "Well you let us have access to all the information, so we can do whatever we want with it." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > Charlemont residents rejected the Comcast offer in a vote at a special town meeting Thursday.

In order to participate in their democracy, you have to physically attend a town meeting on a weekday? That is fucked up. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I feel like we need more community efforts. So many different cultures but we need to ban together, to support each other against corporations trying to milk us dry. It like rooting for the home basketball team. If only it was political(about our lives).  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I just wanted to say it's always a little odd when I see my "home town"* pop up in an article on a major site/publication.

*technically the next town over, but this is a really rural small town area, so there were 9 surrounding towns that fed onto the same MS/HS. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Can.. can we do that? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I wish my town rejected Comcast... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yeah, it was kinda the same thing where I live in Northern Minnesota. It is quite a small town, and a lot of people live outside the city limits. Century Link wouldn't provide the infrastructure to dig all of the fiber optic cables to the rural residents. So, a local Co-op came in, dug them and offered 1 gig download.... now Century Link is trying to offer internet outside city limits LOL WTF. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Every county should do this, let alone towns.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I wish my city would vote against comcast. We have horrible service.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Good for them. Fuck comcast and all the other big cable/internet companies. I remember for a while I had ATT with some stupid bundle package. Then one day my bill went from 60 dollars to almost 300. Turns out they had subscribed me to a "limited time free subscription" to premium channels. 

They didnt tell me that the subscription only lasted 90 days for free then they would start charging me and the only way to stop the service is to call. 

I came to realize I didnt need all those channels since I dont watch tv as it is, I dont have a house phone, and I really only used the internet. 

These days all I have is internet through cox, a Netflix subscription, and a fire stick with kodi. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Comcast will just find and pay a Representative (like Marsha Blackburn) who will pass a bill that makes municipal fiber illegal. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Very exciting news!

[We](https://heightsbroadband.com) in the Cleveland, Ohio area join many other communities that are trying to accomplish something similar. Many across the US have accomplished something similar. Not far from us is [FairlawnGIG](https://www.fairlawngig.net/). ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Good

Take the power out of the hands of corporate oligopolies. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I have the budget Internet from Comcast in a small rural town. Get about 1.5-2.5mbps. Yep, you read that right. They told me this is normal speeds when I called about extremely slow uploads and simple YouTube videos stuttering. It doesn’t even legally qualify as “broadband” [according to the FCC](https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/29/7932653/fcc-changed-definition-broadband-25mbps). Yet upgrading to the next tier (something like 15-25mbps) will cost $30 or $40 more per month (so probably $70/month). We have no alternative ISPs to choose from. Pathetic ripoff artists...hate Comcast.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ $1,466,972 / 1,300 people in the town / 20 year pay is a little over $50/person/yr, absolutely worth it to not put up with Comcast's shit. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ But seriously. What kind of bumbling, cross-eyed stumblefuck would genuinely believe that large corporate ownership of internet service is ever going to produce better results than a democratically financed system? Shills I can understand. Their job is to lie and mislead. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Your Tax Dollars built the internet, so why are we rewarding Comcast for doing nothing? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So they're asking for almost $500k [on top of the $400 billion we've already given ISPs](https://www.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5839394) to build out infrastructure for a service they'll charge us for.

  ~cmt~ This is probably gonna be one of the least controversial posts on /r/politics to make it to the top of Reddit. A hatred for telecoms and Comcast is one of the few things unifying Reddit. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ As a Burlington, VT resident: love local telecom and love to see people defending competition and the right to fast and affordable internet. However, as a customer of Burlington Telecom and an observant follower of local politics I would advise caution to all small to medium sized cities to be circumspect in making this leap.

For us, the deadweight of BT defaulting on their bond dragged the whole city’s credit rating and economy down. They also owe the local taxpayers upwards of 17 millions. And we have watched our local politicians become shifty surrounding the sale of the public utility to a private provider. 

While on an idealistic basis public fiber is an incredibly alluring idea, without good management and funding and interest in public oversight, the taxpayer can find themselves in a tough position with a bunk city budget, detracting from other social services, as well as angry at their local leaders for becoming very back-room-dealing around the governing and, in our case, the sale of public fiber. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Comcast also likes to go to court to make sure those same municipalities are unable to extend their services outside of their boundaries, they hate competition.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Comcast gets worst by the year. Terrible company  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Resources such as water, and electric all classify as public utilities (in my state of California). Does internet classify as a public utility? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pay 600 a month to Comcast for 20 down 3 up or 70 bucks to municipal fiber for 1kdown1milup ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ My town of 1000 people in Tennessee is getting fiber optic through the local electrical co-op because nobody will bring in anything better than DSL. They started building it out in October. Glad to see more and more of this.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I love this; I hope it becomes a trend.

*Fuck* Comcast.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I wish we could do this in my small town. I absolutely despise both of the slow ass, expensive providers we have. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ benefits of municipal fiber: Higher connection speed, more reliable, costs less and handled by people who, should they fuck up, will get voted out of office.

benefits of comcast: literally none. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Fuck yes. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wait until it needs to be upgraded or fixed. It will end up like our highway and bridges. Everyone wants everything and no one wants to pay for it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Prepare to be sued and forced to use Comcast against your will ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Good. Hope it hurt their feelings, too, even just a little bit. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Free market decided that the free market sucks? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~  Hopefully comcast doesn't bribe the state government to block local rule.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm all for state-run internet until the state decides to start censoring things... then again, I'd rather the state decided what to censor than having Comcast decide to fleece me for basic access.   Feels like I'm fucked either way. ~end~

  ~cmt~ [Video link to meeting](https://www.c-span.org/video/?455813-1/president-trump-democratic-leaders-clash-border-funding)


EDIT:

Changed link to C-Span ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I loved the fact that Pelosi and Schumer were pinching him verbally and every time they did, he felt it and got angrier by the second which resulted in him throwing a temper tantrum at the very end. Watch the video, it was great.  
  

EDIT: LA Times reports that after the meeting Trump flicked away a folder and scattered briefing materials in frustration. He was furious that Schumer wouldn't even look at him but at the pool cameras while talking. (Reminder that it was Trump who brought the pool cameras because he thought he can make a power play).

  ~cmt~ I like how the stock market crashed 200 points while this was happening, as though it suddenly occurred *"Oh....shit, this is how he is negotiating with China, isn't it".* ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is such a fucking disgrace

Trump really doesn’t get it- Democrats WON. So there will NOW have to have negotiations.

The my way or highway will NOT work- it never worked even with Republican owned house and senate.

Things are gonna get fucking so much worse in 2019

And pence wAs Literraly  a Ken Doll. 

People actually voted for this guy/administration? Again? 

People who still associate with this madness don’t care about America or its image- its just hate towards anything Obama and Democrats and ( they) want to win at all costs- even if destroys the fabric of this nation.





 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Loved watching Nancy and Chuck, especially Nancy, stand up to that idiot bully. Fuck him and fuck his Wall, go talk to Mexico jackass. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why are we even having a discussion over how to budget for the wall? The president made a promise that Mexico would pay for it, and that is flatly where this debate ends. He's supposed to be a master dealmaker, so we ought to take him at his word and let him make them cough up those funds. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ OMG Nancy just played him

 House Minority Leader Pelosi said “the Trump shutdown is a luxury that  the American people cannot afford” and that she’d be happy to make the  first vote of the new Congress passing a bill to re-open the government  if Trump does decide on a shutdown.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Toddler throws temper tantrum ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump got played like fiddle on live tv once again. At least this time it was by Nancy and Chuck and not Putin. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Lmao how long until he calls it the "Schumer Shutdown?"

Minutes?  Hours? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That boy ain't right. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pelosi and Schumer got Trump to say this on live TV in what Trump thought would be a surprise power move for him to own the libs. Schumer could barely contain his laughter.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That was expertly played by Pelosi ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And we’re going to be proud to see you hauled off to prison! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "If we don't get what we want, one way or the other, whether it's through you, through a military, through anything you wanna call, I will shut down the government"  


What the actual fuck is happening in our government right now? This is not democracy. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wow. This was amazing. Thank you President Trump for having these transparent meetings so we all can see how "The Art of the Deal" is done in front of our eyes. Don't forget to call the National Enquirer about the rumors of Chucks hair transplant. 

Seriously, Nancy & Chuck should take every opportunity to debate Individual 1 in front of the cameras. I mean, when you have to bring two cheat cards with you and read the Fox News statistics to remember what the hell you're talking about, (your number 1 campaign issue which you claim to know everything about, including how many terrorists you have caught) then you are really winning. 

And tell Mr. Wallpaper I said hello. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And [Pence](https://twitter.com/DavidWright_CNN/status/1072544343657992192) doesn't say a fuckin word ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ 717 billion dollar military budget and they're arguing over a wall. They're blatantly stealing from the American people. They can't fund Medicaid or social security and they're arguing over a wall. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He is proud to hurt Americans. Just think about that. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I half expected Pelosi and Schumer to openly high five each other after he uttered that with no self awareness  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ God, Pence is literally furniture. An actual ventriloquist dummy. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump:  “I have the House” 

Nancy:  “you do NOT have the House” 

Trump:  “I could if I wanted to...” 

Nancy:  “do it, then” 

Anybody that argued Nancy shouldn’t be Speaker this time around is foolish.  This is literally the first time I’ve seen anyone call him out directly to prove some asinine claim he made.  This is what we all need to start doing to him. 

“A lot of people are saying...” 

“Which people?  What are their names?” 

“We caught 10 terrorists...” 

“We did?  Tell us more?  How did you catch them?  Was a wall involved?  Was it necessary in order to catch them?  What were their nationalities?  What were their plans?”  

We cannot continue to let him say arbitrarily say stuff with no follow up.    ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Americans are gonna lose either way.

I wonder how building the wall benefits Trump? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ WOW WHAT A BIG AND POWERFUL PRESIDENT WHO HAS TO HURT HIS NATION AND SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THE BEST NEGOTIATOR IN THE WORLD CAN'T GET THE HOMBRES IN MEXICO TO PAY FOR HIS WALL. 

&#x200B;

Such a good president! wow! Tremendous!

&#x200B;

&#x200B; ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ When the government shuts down, it should mean *all* of the executive branch shuts down.  No special funding for state dinners while your average Joe American can’t get a passport because the State Department is closed.  No Air Force One to take you to Mar-a-Lago every weekend, no fucking motorcade driven by federal employees, no Secret Service to protect the Trumps while everyone else suffers - nothing.

That fat ass should have to wake up every morning and make his own fucking bed in an ice cold Whitehouse while the government goes dark.  

The whole problem is that a “shutdown” is always engineered so that (1) the president doesn’t experience any effects of the shutdown within his own bubble, (2)  the military doesn’t experience any effects within its own bubble, and (3) the SS checks keep getting printed and sent.

The president should be the first to suffer during a shutdown, not the last.  The military should be on bare bones - everyone eats fucking MREs, generals included, while there is no money.  Instead, federal workers get furloughed and the national parks close and there is almost no political pressure because every vital function of government continues. 

Cut those SS checks going out for just two weeks and I guarantee there is suddenly enough votes to override the president’s veto.  And pass a budget taking all of his toys away.  The president wants to travel to Mar-a-Lago this weekend?  Fine, he fucking pays for it, because that’s not in the budget.  And that goes for every rally, golf outing, and overseas public humiliation.  Congress can and should cut the president’s budget down to just enough to keep the lights on at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He gets so frustrated when women contradict him. What a pussy.


Shut it down, Donald. LOVE to see how that works for you. Bitch.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Is mike pence the most useless person in the entire world or what? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Donald Tantrump.

Still hitting new lows. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Schumer was sitting there smirking like the cat that got the canary. That line about you know the president is in trouble when he brags about getting North Dakota and Indiana. Without missing a beat Trump says , We did get north Dakota and Indiana! Missing the point completely.... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm not a massive fan of Schumer, but I want to give him credit for making sure the narrative stays on point for Democrats, that they have multiple paths to keep the government open, and that we do NOT want the Gov't to shut down, and that it WILL be on the President's shoulders if it happens.

&#x200B;

That is what we need right now. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Did I actually watch the president of US demand money for a wall that he promised Mexico would pay for and then threatening to shut down the government when refused, risking million of peoples income and in the midst of what looks like a stock market recession?

Anyone who can support this president deserves to be called a traitor to everything the US should stand for. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I’m glad the Congress with the Democrats taking over the House will be the first time they oppose the idiocy of Donald Trump. Here’s to more “proud” moments in the future! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Idiot. If he does shut down the government, the Republicans own that. If he doesn't, he was weak and lost to a woman. Perfect. Either way he loses.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Whoever gets the 2020 Democratic nod, they will use this on every commercial, press release and bumper sticker. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Shutting down the government 3 times in 2 years while his party controlled the Presidency, House, and Senate. Great leadership, best ever.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ God Chuck and Nancy baited him so hard and he went for it hook, line and sinker. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Literally couldn't believe my ears when he said it.

The entire exchange was cringe-worthy, from Nancy Pelosi trying to stop the discussion in front of press, to Schumer trying to bait Trump (which he successfully did), to Pence smiling in the background as Trump argued talking points.

Really just such a bizarre and shocking display. Out of everyone in the room, I think Nancy Pelosi came out looking the most adult. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Humpty Trumpty wanted a wall,

Lining the border, 20 feet tall.

The Mexican people agreed with the lout,

“Well pay for the thing if it keeps Trumpty out!”
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well that's because you're an idiot, Donnie. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Dems would be smart not to negotiate on this.  Let the GOP have a shut down government to end their pathetic full control.  Then the Dems can do what they want when they have a stronger hand. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You mean the wall that is simultaneously paid for by Mexico, already started to be built, nearly complete, and also needs taxpayer funding to begin construction?

It's the wall that is at whatever stage is most convenient at the time. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I love how Nancy schooled trump on how a bill gets passed.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Does anyone know where we can see a full video of the meeting? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump is used to shutting things down because they need more money.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He wasn't able to get republicans to vote for it back when they still controlled the congress... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So I guess Mexico isn't paying for it? Another lie.

And if average Joe taxpayer doesn't cover the bill, you're gonna shut down the government? Proud to do it you say?

Somewhere a democratic strategist is cracking a smile. What a fucking buffoon Donnie is.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >“It’s like a manhood thing with him — as if manhood can be associated with him,” she told her colleagues just now.

Damn, Nancy ain't playing. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Sing it, shitstain. Own it. You’re not getting your fucking wall unless Trump Org pays for it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That whole exchange was cringe! Where is Trump getting his 90% border crossing reduction numbers from? What Wall is he saying they’ve built????

The patience of NP and CS is astounding to sit and listen to his mouth diarrhea. I’m glad they finally spoke up at the end but it’s tough to have a serious debate with this ass hate when facts don’t matter.

What a clown.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He’s literally the worst ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "We caught 10 terrorists over the last very short period of time."

Ridiculous diction aside, is he making this up?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >Trump once again boldly proclaims how proud he is to be so goddamn stupid. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This guy really is the worst President in American history. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The gravity of this whole thing has only now dawned on me. 

Trump was just owned on national TV by an experienced politician who *has the nation's best interests at heart.* 

So how do you think things went when Trump was in that private meeting with Putin, and no TV cameras around?

\#InvokeThe25th ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ “We have immigrants pouring in, a lot of these are terrorists”

Yeah I can think of quite a few terrorists that have appeared in America over the last year. They’re all the American citizens who legally purchased firearms and then went on to fire at the public on the street or in schools. 

And even if these terrorists had actually been Mexicans, statistically most of them would have arrived by plane and would not have been hindered by a fucking wall on the border.

Your logic is a fucking joke republicans. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Finally Chuck had some balls today.  He says, "you're bragging about how secure the border is so why can't we just do the same thing we've been doing?" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ “The Fart of the Deal” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Lmao, a manchild who is so weak that cannot even fire people face to face going up against a political shark like Pelosi? This video needs PG rating at least, lemme grab some popcorn, this should be good. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Brand new thread over at r/conservative blaming the dems for the shutdown. If i wasnt banned there I would post this for them. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ call his bluff, the elections are already over, and a new congress gets sworn in Jan 3rd, thats 23 days from now, he is screaming from a position of weakness, call his bluff, he cant do anything.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If he shuts down the government over a 2000 mile wall, he needs to be impeached. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is why Pelosi is speaker, ladies and gentlemen. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Gotta love the headlines here, [Trump, Pelosi and Schumer have on-camera shouting match as wall talks break down](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/schumer-pelosi-set-to-meet-with-trump-on-wall-but-house-gop-stands-firm/2018/12/11/2604b1ae-fd56-11e8-862a-b6a6f3ce8199_story.html?utm_term=.c7ee28f29552).
That is ridiculous. Only Trump with his reddened face was giving off steam. I saw Pelosi and Schumer being relatively calm and collected.
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I fucking hate this timeline. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ dude, you're bad at your job ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If you haven't watched the video of them fighting, you should.  Ho Lee Shit.  This dude is a fucking imbecile.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The best way to pay for this wall is to dismantle all Trump properties in the world and use that material to construct the wall .  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This was spectacular to watch. It almost beats Trump’s meltdown the day after the mid terms when he screamed at Jim Acosta.

While I was wary about Nancy Pelosi becoming speaker(I was worried about all the bipartisanship talks) she bitch slapped Trump in front of the media and it was amazing. I would still like her to take someone under her wing in case she does become president over the next two years, I think we’ll be fine with her as speaker.

Schumer’s shit eating grin was even better. “When he brings in South Dakota and Indiana, he knows he’s in trouble.”

Pence looked like he’d rather be anywhere but there and is probably cursing Manafort for picking him as VP. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pelosi was completely wonderful in this mockery of a conversation/negotiation. It's a shame she's dealing with two idiots. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm sorry Mr. President but you  just can't build a wall across open desert. There are thousands if not millions of species of animals, insects and who know what else that have to migrate. You can't enforce you're silly border wall on them. You'll destroy the ecosystem.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Child in room: I want a cookie

Adults: You don't need a cookie

Child: But I've been so good at drawing pictures

Adults: What does that have to do with anything

Child: GIVE ME A COOKIE

Adults: You can't have a cookie, it's not necessary for your health

Child: I WILL BURN DOWN THIS HOUSE IF I DON'T GET A COOKIE ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ *10 minutes before meeting, while walking into White House*

Chuck S:  "lol Nance, I bet I can get Cheeto to say, on camera, that he'll shut down the government if he doesn't get his wall."

Nancy P:  "Gimme a break Chuck.  There's no way his staff didn't prep him for a trap that obvious."

Chuck:  "100 bucks."

Nancy:  "You're on."

28 laws subverted. Billions to be spent. Insane environmental damage. All for zero gain.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This entire shambles of a meeting was amazing on so many levels:

- Trump doesn’t tell any of his aides he was gonna do a portion of these talks with the live cameras.

- We got to see “The Art of The Deal” in full display: Whining like a grade schooler and making threats.

- The soundbite of this entire administration in “I’m proud to shut down the government”.

- Mike Pence realizing the end is near for both of them and not saying a word.

- Schumer (and now Pelosi) once again playing Trump like a fiddle on this border wall talk.

I don’t think anything else, until Mueller’s indictments come, well perfectly summarize this entire joke of a Presidency. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm curious about his "facts" about walled sections being more effective. Is there a place I could find those statistics from a legitimate source? I am making a biased assumption that they may be   biased statistics if they are even true so I'd love to challenge my bias.  ~end~

  ~cmt~ Please do, Mr President, show us how your **ENTIRELY Republican controlled government** can't govern at all and none of you deserve your jobs.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump (excerpt) talking to Peña Nieto about the wall January 2017:

Trump: Because you and I are both at a point now where we are both saying we are not to pay for the wall. From a political standpoint, that is what we will say. We cannot say that anymore because if you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that. I am willing to say that we will work it out, but that means it will come out in the wash and that is okay. But you cannot say anymore that the United States is going to pay for the wall. I am just going to say that we are working it out.

Peña Nieto: You have a very big mark on our back, Mr. President, regarding who pays for the wall. This is what I suggest, Mr. President – let us stop talking about the wall. I have recognized the right of any government to protect its borders as it deems necessary and convenient. But my position has been and will continue to be very firm saying that Mexico cannot pay for that wall. 

Trump: But you cannot say that to the press. The press is going to go with that and I cannot live with that. You cannot say that to the press because I cannot negotiate under those circumstances.

  ~cmt~ Trump does know that Mueller keeps working if the govt shuts down, right? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Man I would pay good money for Ten minutes with Pence's browser history.

You know that guys into some freaky shit.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "I also made a doodie in my diapies! I'm proud to make poopy pants, and to shut down the government! I'm such a big boy Pwesident" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Do it. Shut it down, Trump. Own that shut down. It will go well for you. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He’s an idiot. He just signed a defense bill for $750 billion a year in spending. Party of fiscal responsibility my ass. Bernie wanted free tuition for all at a rate of $70 billion a year and Republicans said we couldn’t afford it. UK’s total spending for military is 40 billion. China who is second is spending is like $200 billion. And then we are at $750 billion. Insanity. if we cut are spending to $300 billion we would have enough money for free college tuition to all, unversal healthcare, fixed the bridges. Instead we spend what the next 8 countries do combined. And now he wants more money for the wall or else he will shut the government down. Fuck off. 



 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Call it what it is. It’s a temper tantrum.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Somewhere, in an alternate universe, a stoner puts down his bong and says:  “Bruh, somewhere there’s an alternate universe where Trump is president.”  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why doesn't he just get Mexico to pay for it like he said he would? I don't see why taxpayers need to foot the bill for this thing when that was never the plan. ~end~

  ~cmt~ My favorite exchange in this whole mess: 

>Trump: Nancy, we gained in the Senate. Excuse me, did we win the Senate? We won the Senate.

>Schumer: When the president brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he's in real trouble.

>Trump: I did. We did win, North Dakota, and Indiana. 

Christ, he's such a fucking idiot. All he hears is the word "win" and he just vomits out word salad. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ As hard as it is to watch this, I wish all of Trump's interactions were televised because it shows how big of a fucking idiot he is.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He said "we caught 10 terrorists." I'd like to know when, where, and who.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Next: "I'm going to shut down the government that secures the border if I don't get the billions to build a wall to secure the border that I have already secured." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Billions of waste.

Reminder, [the admin spent $13+ million to hire 2 border patrol agents so far](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/12/customs-and-border-protection-paid-14-million-to-recruit-two-agents-government-report-finds/). ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why doesn't Trump just ask Mexico for the funds? After all, he promised that Mexico would pay for it, and there's no way he would *lie* about that. Right? Right? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I appreciated what Schumer added at the end outside.

Trump had a temper tantrum last time for money. Well, he got it. And he only spent 6% of it... *6%.* Now he wants more. I'm a little disappointed he didn't pull that card directly to Trump's face in front of the cameras cause that's the language America understand. Facts. So much for fiscal responsibility. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I want to know exactly what was done at the locations he reeled off and what those stats represent and how true they are. 

I also want to know if that was a record amount of times the word, wall was said in a 15 minute period.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Mr. Art of the Deal was not too convincing in his meeting today with Pelosi and Schumer. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Better ask Mexico then eh?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I liked the part where he was talking about Israel's wall and said theirs is "99.9% effective and ours will be..." and paused as if he realized claiming better than 99.9% would be ridiculous. So he said "at least as good". But in the end he couldn't help himself and added "if not better".  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "I need ten billion dollars. Write a cashier's check out to Donald J. Trump, I'll make sure the money goes where it should. And in the memo line, be sure to write NO COLLUSION. That makes it legally binding and fact." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'll donate to a fund that constructs a wall around Individual 1, Cask of Amontillado style ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Idiot #1: "Who is going to pay for the wall?" 

Other idiots: "MEXICO!!!"

Meanwhile, the media has forgotten that this was the promise. Now our representatives are discussing whether we should pay for that wall.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I guess this meeting is like Pulp Fiction; everyone has a different favorite part. Mine was when Pelosi said he didn't have the votes in the House for the wall, and he said  "If I needed the votes for the wall in the House, I would have them in one session. It would be done." Sooo....do it? Go get the votes? Or is he saying he doesn't need them and therefore he doesn't need to do it? Who the hell knows. And my favorite part of Pulp Fiction is when Willis keeps choosing different weapons in the pawn shop.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ My idiot relatives will post on Facebook after the government shutdown saying the government is useless and this is exactly why we need Trump in charge...

Let’s see. He said Mexico was going to pay for it, now he’s making up a bunch of fake numbers to get US to pay for it, he doesn’t have the votes, so he’s going to shutdown the government and tweet out blaming the democrats 

The idiots that only read his tweets and maybe some FOX news here or there will just think the government is a disaster and DC needs to get its shit together and not realize it’s the shit throwing orange gibbon who instead of playing chess and getting beat is flipping the whole board over sending all the pieces everywhere saying it’s the Dems fault ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why hasn't the GOP-led Congress approved the wall in the past 2 years?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ A fascists enemies are simultaneously laughably weak and terrifyingly strong. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I watched the interview on youtube - what bothered me more than the whole exchange between Trump, Pelosi and Schumer were the comments people made about the video. So many of the commenters, assuming they are actual people, were excited that "once again Trump owned the liberals". It's disappointing being reminded how many people out there are OK with things that this administration is doing. ~end~

Guess the Trump hasn't figured out how to get that payment to his Russian buddies yet.. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Remember when the “Mission Accomplished” banner was a big deal?  Now that equivalent is just another Tuesday in this dumpster fire of an administration. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Tell him OK, the wall's approved...you can start construction as soon as the check arrives from Mexico. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "This brings large scale crime and disease" - Or, shit that was proven otherwise keeps getting said because racist scumbag won't stop saying it. Sorry, I don't have the links but I remember all of the "rhetoric" being basically bullshit racist fear mongering.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ His brain is just....fucked.  Seriously. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If I was there, I'd ask him how shutting down the American Government was going to help him fulfill his promise that Mexico was gonna pay for it. Because all it really does is prevent real Murricans who work for the US Government from making any money.

That won't help his economy... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He is batshit fucking crazy by any standard. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That’s because it costs 13.6million to place just two border agents, according to recent headlines.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The Democrats should agree to match dollar for dollar what Trump can secure from Mexico for the wall. "There you go Mr. President. You have your funding, now go get it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He’s trying so hard to stretch those tiny little fingers, but they just won’t grow! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And here we are, back to talking about the border again. He got sick of the Chief of Staff speculation so he brought in some democrats to yell at about wanting to let terrorists in and give us all something 'new' to gawk at and argue over. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He meant that he secured the Canadian border... Now he needs to secure the border down south ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Follow the money : who stands to profit from a $5B wall project.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is ridiculous, Trump doesn’t need Congress and the American taxpayers for this, he’s having the Mexicans pay for the Wall just like he said they would.  It was the cornerstone of his campaign.  Where have you people been?! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Years after saying Mexico would pay for it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I just watched the video of the Trump-Pelosi-Schumer meeting. It wasn't even an hour later. Trump contradicted himself about this within the span of probably less than one minute. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This headline pretty much sums up this disaster of an administration. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Stuff a check for billions of dollars in an envelope at the top of a mountain and tell him it's his if his fat ass can get it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > “People do not yet realize how much of the Wall, including really effective renovation, has already been built,” Trump tweeted. “If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall. They know how important it is!”

Thank God Emperor Trump that we know have a military that can pull non-existing resources out of its ass. Or maybe that's how Mexico is going to pay for it. We'll just have the military invade Mexico to gather the resources to build the Wall.

&#x200B; ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Solving the problem means you have to move on to solving other problems, it's better to just play the "presidential victim" card and whine about the problem instead of actually fixing it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And his cultists will simultaneously praise him for securing the border and blame dems for failing to secure the border.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Individual one told us the Mexicans would happily pay for the wall. Why is individual one asking for money? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ “But less than an hour later, Trump seemed to realize that claiming the border is secure is not a good bargaining position ahead of a meeting about funding a border wall.”

Dumbest motherfucker on the planet.  Tack on the standard pile of offensive lies, and you got your typical Trump word vomit.  

I THOUGHT MEXICO WAS GONNA PAY FOR IT DUMMY?  Wasn’t that his biggest, and most consistent promise?   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He wants the wall budget so he can funnel it into his pockets via his cronies' construction companies. Mark my words. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I just sat down to watch this “conversation” on YouTube, and had to take a break about halfway through.    It was exhausting not only to listen to Trump bloviate for ten minutes—- but once everything broke down, it just became unbearable.  A bunch of old and out of touch people should not be in charge of our country’s future.  

We need people steering the ship who will actually make it to the far off horizon.

Whether or not one agrees with Trump, or agrees with Pelosi et al., I felt embarrassed for everyone involved.  I couldn’t shake asking myself, “why is this even happening right now?”— half-rhetorically, half-helplessly.

I’m just one of those “the answer lies in the middle” assholes, yes—- and now I think I’m finally starting to understand the ramifications of my lack of participation in my country’s political process.  

I apologize for not giving a shit soon enough. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Mexico still paying for it?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is legitimately funny. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Crazy, ain't it?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Republicans planned to do something similar on the border under Bush. They even passed an act to fund improved border fencing along hundreds of miles. Yet most of the funds were never appropriated. Guess why: because everyone involved realized it was an ineffective boondoggle. If they couldn't get that done then, what makes anyone think they can do something many times more expensive now?

"The Wall" will never be anything more than a red-meat pander. Shadows cast on a cloud of xenophobic vapor. No conservative with a brain thinks it's necessary, cost effective, or feasible. But white supremacists want their monument, so they have to pretend to be on board.    ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ count up the ridiculous amount of times he promised Mexico would pay for it and remind him with the actual number ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pelosi and Schumer should pass a bill saying Congress will match any funds put up by Mexico to finance the wall - NPR style.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Overly focused on what he won and not what he lost. Great ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I say we compromise. Let's give Trump 4 walls: 2 at 6 feet in length and 2 at 8 feet. Assemble them so they form an 6' x 8' box and put Trump inside of it. Problem solved. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This just in: Trump is a dumb piece of shit ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You're hot and you're cold you're yes and you're no you're in and you're out you're up and you're down... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I know this is crazy talk, but has Trump got a plan to funnel wall construction money to himself? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Breitbart ran an article recently saying that Mexico will pay for the wall because we will deny public assistance to "illegals."  Instead of "illegals" getting welfare, we will use that money to pay for the wall and somehow, it means that even though the American taxpayer is still footing the bill, Mexico is paying.  The whole thing was a stunning display of stupidity going full circle and completely missing the target, but calling it a win anyway. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Sector clear..


....


NOT CLEAR! NOT CLEAR! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Too bad we elected a moron who's hill to die on is a worthless wall and not infrastructure or education. I guess you get more votes by fear mongering about brown people than you do trying bettering our schools and roads ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ President Trump, you can have any fucking wall you want but you just have to get Mexico to pay for it. *

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I can't find the analysis/article I read about the inherent contradiction and/or flaw in the Nazi's perception of the Jewish people. The closest I can find is this:

[https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/z98gxsg/revision/4](https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/z98gxsg/revision/4)

The passage of import:

> The belief that the Jews were an inferior race to the German **Aryans**, and also represented a threat to the German state.

The article I'm thinking of pointed out that Nazism was destined to fail because of the contradiction that a) Jews are weak, and b) Jews are a threat (strong) and to a certain extent, c) Germans are the supreme race. It led to fractures in the morale of the Nazis when they encountered obstacles that they could not overcome.

&#x200B;

Extremely tangential, but Trump's contradictory statements constantly remind me of this sort of Nazi propaganda. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Let’s set the record straight: this border wall isn’t for border security, it’s for his re-election. This is nothing but a $5B, publicly-funded campaign contribution. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Back to the low hanging fruit again.

Fucking Pathetic! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Republicans cannot open their mouths without contradicting themselves.

They are at once an oppressed, persecuted minority while controlling every branch of government.

They employ inhuman immigration tactics and then defend said tactics by arguing (incorrectly) that Obama did the same thing even though they campaigned on how terrible Obama was on immigration.

I mean, they are so stupid I don't know how they breath. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Senility is a terrible condition. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He’s just plain Nuts!!! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ As we have been saying for a long time. A wall is a more efficient way. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Could have sworn some asshole said that Mexico will pay for it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Proof trump is cloned and these clones are running amok causing chaos. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Securing something temporarily and securing it permanently are two things. You can plug a hole in an aircraft carrier with wooden pegs, it still needs millions to propely fix up ~end~ 
  ~cmt~  What has happened is the existing wall was under repair by Obama when Trump took over. It just continued. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ [removed] ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Tbf Bush secured the border ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Links vox  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ what happened...did he fart? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Sounds like the government. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ These statements are not mutually exclusive. At the moment the border is TEMPORARILY secured by the military. The wall is PERMANENT security. This sub is the biggest leftist circle jerk I've ever seen.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Uhh yea. It's because there is a dinky makeshift fence in a lot of spots that need to be reinforced... ~end~

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Schumer and Pelosi were playing Mr Art of the Deal like a fiddle.  

Pelosi, calm and patronizing like a patient kindergarten teacher.  Schumer stepping in and Trump, relieved to be talking "man to man", slipping up and admitting the shutdown would be his fault. Pelosi stepping back in when Trump starts to realize what he was saying.  Perfect tag team.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The good news is he already promised to make Mexico pay for it, and he's a career master dealmaker who keeps his promises, so we don't even need to have this discussion over funding at all. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Fun fact: baby elephants are the second largest land mammal babies on earth, right after Trump. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That entire "meeting" Schumer was trying so hard not to laugh at this toddler throwing a hissy fit because he can't get what he wants...#SAD

&#x200B;

Edit: Spelling ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump finally laid bare the truth behind Republican governance - Do it my way or I'll shut down (or steal) the government! 

VOTE these motherfuckers OUT! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Holy fuck the YouTube comments. Bunch of bots and foreign agents. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pelosi was trying to do this as calmly and civil as possible but you can tell by the look on her face that 2 minutes in, and she's already done with this bullshit and doesn't even know why she bothered.

Meanwhile, Schumer immediately called Trump out in a much more confrontational manner. We need more of this. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Republicans, your leader is child who throws temper tantrums when he doesn’t get his way. 

He has got to be one of the least intelligent sounding people I’ve ever heard talk in my life. Wtf is wrong with you people  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why didn't someone just say "Mr. President, I thought Mexico was going to pay for the wall." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I like that they're using his own bullshit messaging tactics against him-- repeatedly calling it a "Trump shutdown," and accusing him of having a temper tantrum, etc. The guy knows how to dish it out but he has no clue how to take it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Two years! You had two years of controlling all 3 branches! You really think you're going to get a wall once democrats have the house?!? Your own party didn't want the wall! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ My only hope in all this is that Schumer sticks to his guns and we’re not stuck here a week later with headlines like “Trump promises not to repeal gay marriage or Roe v Wade if wall is built, Schumer caves.” 

I’m tired of this when they go low, we go high shit. Kick him right in the balls Chuck and Nancy. Don’t give him or any of them an inch.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Nothing will get him and his racist base a wall.  If the wall was going to be funded it would have happened in the last two years.  He doesn't have enough votes even among his own party. 

The wall is not an effective deterrent to illegal immigration, it is a monument to racism and stupidity.  We get it Trump supporters, we understand why you want to waste the money. It's not happening get over it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Temper tantrump ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If Trump really wanted a wall he would have pushed harder when the Republicans controller both houses of Congress.  He wants an issue.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ McConnell and Ryan could've given Trump his wall already, but they didn't, even when the GOP controlled Congress. Nobody wants this wall.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Diseases and terrorists.  

Our President is a disgusting and racist man.

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Can we get the picture of Obama and the temper tantrum kid at the Whitehouse photoshopped with Trump's face on the kid? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I formally request that we call these “temper tantrumps” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I love that he made him own shutting the govt down,  thanks for that future ad. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What's all this squabbling over funding about? I coulda swore Mexico was gonna front the money for this. He said they would.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Imagine if his campaign message was actually truthful: We're gonna build a wall and Americans are gonna pay for it. If you don't like it, we're gonna shut down the government.  ~end~

  ~cmt~ This is what I want to see the Democrats fighting back against trumps childish and idiotic ideas. Schumer’s anger was in plain view and Pelosi was calm, collected but stinging. I don’t think trump realized he was being insulted to his face.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ahhh I love the smell of check and balance in the morning  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Let's just remember, folks: this is only the first incident. Imagine how hard C&N will troll him starting Jan 3 with control of the House.

They're just gonna fucking onload on this moron, it'll be like watching LeBron 1v1 a 3 year old ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Nice burn, Chuck.  You guys done good today. ~end~

  ~cmt~ “What about some rage tweets?”  — Trump, probably  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I can't even bear to watch this video or any video of Trump for that matter .  Trump just sucks all the energy from normal human beings.  It's healthier to just avoid all exposure to him until he is gone. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That was awesome folks.  ~end~

  ~cmt~ 'Temper Tantrum Trump' has a nice ring to it. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Trump looks like a child. It’s actually pretty embarrassing...

He doesn’t own America. He is our *president. For now. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Why Trump want money to build is awesome wall. Didn’t Mexico was paying for it ? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump's gonna get his wall, he'll get four of them, but they'll be made of bars, and he'll be inside them. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I wish chuck or Nancy would have turned to Pence and said: “So what’s your position on this Mike?” For every awkward question.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If they get a wall, we will need either single payer healthcare or free education in return. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Can we just let the SOLID red states go have their little confederacy already?  Maybe they can get aid from the international community when their economy fails, poverty is rampant, everyone is in jail, no one has any rights left except automatic guns that they can shoot each other with, etc.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Border xenophobia has already been test-driven for public acceptance as recently as the mid term elections, and it failed miserably.  Only an utter moron would revive it to make a pointless stand.

However the Democrats are already mishandling this golden opportunity.  They'll still win this round but not nearly as decisively as they could.

Starting yesterday they should be out there as one voice branding "the Democrat infrastructure plan" and the "Democrat medical marijuana plan" and "renewable energy job spree" and a few other things they want or which will be popular.  I'm not saying whether these ideas are good or bad, just that they are catnip for the moderates, the undecideds, the middle ground that will swing the 2020 election.  Someone's going to claim them and if Trump falsely plants that flag first, the Democrats are missing out.

They should also get their fringe started on branding Trump as an economic terrorist, holding the economy and government hostage if his crazy demands aren't met.

   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is what I voted for. No more "nice" Democrats. Let Dump know he's in for a reckoning. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Under no circumstances should the democrats give him a wall. It’s time to look at things politically like republicans do. Trump not getting a wall done hurts him politically. He had a majority in both houses for two years, if he wasn’t an idiot he should have gotten it done then.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Donald Trump is bombing countries and perpetuating the drug war, which destabilizes regions and causes people to flee their country. If Trump is so concerned about people fleeing their country (and coming here), maybe he should stop the bombs and end the drug war. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The best part about dems taking the house is exactly what Schumer just put out there: His temper tantrums are now just going to fall on deaf ears rather than constantly be catered to by a completely complicit  GOP. His free ride is over and starting on January 5th, consequences return to the republican side of the aisle and when they cry foul, always remind them not to act like such snowflakes.. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hopefully Kushner wasn't waiting with a bone saw  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I think that “not paid by Mexico anymore” line was too savage. And with all the bricks he is shitting at the moment, individual 1 may be able to single handedly build that wall. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Temper Tantrump. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump doesn’t get what he wants, so he throws a tantrum?! Mister Art of the Deal is the worst negotiator ever! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trumps cult doesnt care if people get screwed over when the gov't shutdowns happen. Thats why they are the worst of the worst people in America. If take an immigrant over a Republican any day if the week. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It might get him 4 walls, plus a floor and ceiling. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Even if he doesn't throw a tantrum, Trump shouldn't get a wall. There should never be talk from Democrats about funding for a 1,000 mile long wall. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Temper tanTrump ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >Why is this even a debate? I thought you said Mexico was going to pay for it?

  ~cmt~ If you want to wall go to China .China has a walls ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I think the government should give Trump his wall. In fact make it 4 walls around him!

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So these guys went into a meeting with a  press conference already called. They knew Trump would go off the rails. I wish I could say this made them political geniuses, but it's pretty clear that anyone could make Trump say the worst possible thing.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No but it will get him prison time, hopefully. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You tell 'im, Chucky!!! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The look on Mike Pence's face, during Trump's tirade says all that anyone needs to know.  ~end~

Narrator: He won’t.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Oh man, the moment it came out of his mouth you could just see Chuck and Nancy's eyes light up with the realization that they had just won the exchange.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ My jaw dropped when he said he would take responsibility for it and not blame the democrats. They didn't even have to try to get him to say that. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Watching her explain to Trump how the house works was like watching some one try to explain how an airplane works to a 4 year old.  I love when she says to him, "go do it."   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wasn't Mexico supposed to pay for the wall?

&#x200B; ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I just peeked over at TD just to see what if any coverage there was on this.  They think this went *well* for trumpy.  I'm so saddened by the lack of critical thinking involved in equating "border security" with a "5 billion dollar con job".  Of *course* dems want border security.  We can have border security without bulldozing butterfly sanctuaries, and giving people something to tear down in the future when we finally realize we're all in this together. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Like 80% or more Americans oppose the wall. This is a stupid hill to die on. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Now, ZERO DOLLARS for the wall, or no deal. We have the power. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ People need to watch the whole video here, they ask Pelosi why she wouldn't have the full meeting out in the open. 

"We didn't want to say, in front of those people, 'You don't know what you're talking about'." 

It's embarrassing what is going on in this country. Out-right incompetence is being rubber stamped by the GOP on a daily basis, not to mention all those little felonies he committed.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ We all know that Trump will start blaming (from Florida) Pelosi and Schumer if the government shuts down.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Is it really necessary, Mr. President, to *always* appear to be sitting on a toilet? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Schumer is hilarious. 

He made the comment about N Dakota and Indiana and looks around like "sick burn, right?"

Pelosi is a got damned baller. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well that gives the media alot of clips to play of Trump once the shut down starts and people start to get mad ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Dems: "Trump's going to shit his pants"

GOP: "Dems are going to shit their pants"

Trump: "I JUST SHIT MY PANTS THAT WAS NOT THE DEMS I DID IT ALL BY MYSELF" ~end~

  ~cmt~ Pence looks like he's praying to be raptured up immediately. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ trump pretty much gave the democrats an early holiday gift. He is so generous, especially on a silver platter.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why try to stop a player when he's about to kick an own-goal right into the net? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Listen, if you want a wall on the border and you do not live in a border state, shut up. The number of people in my conservative area who are afraid of immigrants while living in Northern Idaho and Western Montana while open carrying a .45 and an AR in the pick up rack is laughable.  There are grown ass men afraid of immigrants and I have to wonder why am I not afraid?  

I dont wish to pay for a border wall.  I don't think it is needed, i don't believe it will be enough and I really, really do not wish to pay for it.  There is no way it will be built for the prices quoted.  It will be several times that price and we all damn well know that.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He kept saying to Schumer "the last one was your fault and that didn't work out well for you."

HOW IS THAT REFUTING ANYTHING?

If the last one was supposedly caused by Schumer and didn't work out well for him, and this one is caused by Trump, logic follows that it won't work out for Trump. I know logic is not a Trump thing but this is extra illogical. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Basically:

Trump: I have the House votes but it is pointless because Dems in the Senate will kill it there.

Pelosi: You don't have enough support from your own party in the House. The fuck you talking about?

Trump: NYU-HUH I DO.

Pelosi: Prove it. Let the House vote.

Trump: No LALAALALALAALAAA I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

Fucking man child. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The art of the deal ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Master negotiator.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I don't know if I'm more concerned about what appears to be Donald Trump's belief that he could best Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer in a public battle of wits or his confidence that whatever line he feeds his moron base about how he definitely didn't say this will be bought unconditionally.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ But no matter how many times they replay the tape of him SAYING this was on him, his sycophants will still call it fake news and say it didn’t happen. When someone as “respected” as Orrin Hatch is willing to sell his soul that quickly, the basic Trump supporter will be an easy target. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Part of me wonders - a 25% competent Chief of Staff would make sure that this conversation never EVER happens on live TV, regardless of who the president is, and especially since Trump couldn’t win an argument with a clogged toilet.
So who allowed this to happen? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why the closed doors discussion?  "We didn't want to contradict the president when he was putting forth figures that had no reality to them.  No basis in fact."

Damn!  They straight up didn't want to humiliate him on National TV and said pretty much that. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Schumer wasn’t looking at Trump because he was going to die laughing in his face.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ How to make friends and influence people: shut down the government during Christmas. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Pence looks ...*pensive* . ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Please proceed. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump says this now.  When the government actually shuts down, he'll blame the democrats anyway. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Government shutdown, stock market tanking, US ridiculed around the world, trade war, left and right hate each other... I’d say we’re officially in the trump presidency! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Truly incredible the level of incompetence Trump exhibits. Constantly repeating himself, talking over Pelosi, being too dumb to understand Schumer's remarks, etc. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump supporters are going to have to spin the shit out of this mistake; being responsible for shutting down the government has always been deeply unpopular.

No doubt FOXNews will spend the next 10 days lauding the virtue of shutting down the government... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I enjoyed this pissing match a lot more than I should have. This is a sneak preview on how the next two years are going to go.

They owned him like a little bitch on live national tv. Schumer’s shit eating grin was glorious. Nancy was a badass.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ i was iffy on pelosi 2019 if everyone is ousted, but after this i say bring it on. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why don't they bring up his campaign promise of Mexico paying for it? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Fuck this entire corrupt family & administration of criminals. I hope they don't pass a Fucking thing accept articles of impeachment. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What kind of idiot would shut down the federal government days before Christmas, making sure his own party gets blamed for the Trumpdown, when all he has to do is wait about 3 weeks so he can blame the Trumpdown on Democrats? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I watched the video, they were decisively not happy to agree.  They do not want a gov't shutdown, but they agreed that he would own it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Kratosgivinganod.gif ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Nice burn but Trump didn't get it. Obliviousness is his armour. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Anybody know if trump's statistics on traffick reduction are based in reality? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Anyone know where I can watch the majority of this ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump is so easily played.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump needs new toys to play with other than US politics. I could see the steam coming out of Schumer's ears and expected him to punch Trump. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This makes me worry, what if Republicans could ever get elected a President who wasn’t a certifiable moron ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I think he wants to shut it down so he can avoid the House calling him into question and investigating him constantly. Will that work?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Tomorrow's tweet: Democrats are threatening to shut down the government.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I’m convinced Mike Pence is a wax animatronic.. thing.. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He is so malignantly narcissistic that he thinks the words he's saying aren't relevant to whether or not he "wins" a discussion or negotiation. Just the fact he states words, any words, emphatically is enough to convince him that he's won.

Someone like this, there's only one thing you should do, put him in front of the cameras early and often. Watch him flop in the wind and say anything because his brain isn't engaged in these discussions.

Democrats didn't ask for this today, but I think they've been handed a winning formula.

We haven't seen these kinds of discussions before, because Republicans have been running the show. Democrats need to make a show of wanting to publicly get Trump in front of them to show off his "masterful negotiation" skills. His hubris will take it from there. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ 100% he blames them still. Words have no meaning  in Trumpland. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Mr. President, at this juncture I think it would be remiss of me not to remind you of the 'no take-backsies, do-overs, or reversals' statute of 1996." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ LMAO @ MIKE. PENCE’S.FUCKIN. FACE. during this exchange ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ i didn't even see the bow they played him like a fiddle so well. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ All I see are people playing to their own base.  No minds were changed during this exchange. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ She SMOCKED his ass.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ MCConnell already released a statement pre-blaming dems ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I can’t stand all snip and paste news videos. These types of news post don’t cover enough and the headlines always generate a hook to get riled up . Watch the full video uncut and then think for yourself.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He acts like such a baby in the video shot in the oval office. Jesus Christ dude, eat and take a nap. What a fucking moron. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump is really good at playing himself. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Can't wait until Republicans start saying shutdowns are a good thing.

Assuming Trump actually takes the blame or his base even knows he said he would when he ultimately doesn't. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Not a "shutdown", but a "Trumpdown" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pence made more sense than Trump. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I hope Democrats just keep playing that video over and over again when Trump shuts down the government in 10 days ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump is not worried about his political career. The Democrats in the room are . The full video shows it . All the talk about bringing in transparency and then wanting to do a private debate all shown on camera in the full unedited video by the Democrats.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The great deal maker at it again! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why is any of this happening?? Republicans still control the House and Senate. This is fucking ridiculous, his own party doesn't want to give him the money to build that bullshit wall. Why in the hell would the Dems do it. This is all fucking dumb...Oh wait, it's Donald Trump. Nevermind, it all makes sense it doesn't make sense. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I had a lapse of judgement as a kid where I agreed to give a friend a playing card of some kind as long as I could let him keep it and watch him play somebody else with it.  He did more work than Pelosi and Schumer did to make Trump say he would take the blame for a government shut down that is caused by funding he can't get for a mostly built wall that isn't real yet that we shouldn't have to pay for because he said Mexico would pay for it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The only thing a government shut down threatens are the people earning a living from the government's teet.  The average working American never sees an impact on his/her daily life.....it means nothing. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I would've handled this conversation a lot differently than Pelosi or Schumer. Put someone with sass in there, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Pelosi and Schumer just sort of do the Hillary thing where they say they strongly disagree with Trump, disagree with what he says, make Trump say stupid stuff, make sarcastic comments to Trump, but don't get nearly as loud or as frustrated as Trump. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I wish Pelosi had more teeth... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Lol theres no spinning this in favor of those 2 creeps. r/politics is so fucking astroturfed its scary  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well as a Hoosier, I see what the dems think about us. We are just a smirk to the left. That’s fine, keep thinking what you think ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Shut the shitty federal government down and leave it shut down. The people do not need a bloated central government, the people would be in a better place if we eliminated all centralized governments and just had a regional government with laws based on the will of the people. ~end~

  ~cmt~ I love the writing at Esquire. Raw and brutally honest. 

>Watch as Pelosi tries, not altogether angrily, to explain to him that he doesn't have the votes for the big, beautiful, stupid wall for which, of course, Mexico is going to pay. She says the votes aren't there. He keeps saying he can get them instantly, but that the problem is that he can't get the votes in the Senate. They're both right. He doesn't have the votes in either place. But he runs down all the applause lines that get the rubes all ginned up at his rallies, and Pelosi keeps calmly telling him that, while he's as full of shit as the Christmas goose, nevertheless he and his big, beautiful, stupid wall should get further stuffed anyway. 

>(You should also notice that, off to one side, Mike Pence clearly has been shot with the trank gun by the Secret Service.)

>Even Schumer suddenly discovers a thin vein of iron in his spine and maneuvers El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago into bragging about shutting down the government unless he gets his way, thereby undercutting any political strategy the Republicans in Congress might have been developing to blame a prospective shutdown on the Democrats. That sound you hear is the Republican congressional leadership taking delivery of a barge-load of bourbon. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Pelosi keeps calmly telling him that, while he's as full of shit as the Christmas goose, nevertheless he and his big, beautiful, stupid wall should get further stuffed anyway." 

That line should win this author the Pulitzer. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I want to frame this [picture.](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pelosi-1544559790.jpg) It's like watching a kindergarten teacher explain the golden rule to a brat. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ First thing I noticed when I saw the picture in the article is the body language from Pence. He looks like he's trying to distance himself from Trump by leaning away. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If all you did was listen to her routine press conferences, you'd know she's a brilliant tactician.  This should come as no surprise.  (And she'll impeach the fucker as soon as the time is right.) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >PELOSI: You will not win.

She knows there is no support for the wall even among republicans. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It’s been documented by research, but women get run over in speaking time more than men. Too many times, Trump cut her off, but not Schumer. I really wished Schumer wouldn’t have done the same, but he kinda did too.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm not gonna lie. Even though I've always supported Nancy, I've always felt she was just way too nice. 

Well, she showed me what the fuck is up today. I stand corrected.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Nobody is shocked that Pelosi showed superb strength of character. My surprise was watching Chuck Schumer actually stand up for his agenda. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > It is not that remarkable if you've ever watched Question Time from any of the various parliaments around the world...(b)ut, because the American government is greased by tawdry piety and transparently artificial civility, the meeting might as well have taken place in the Octogon.        

Pelosi showed Schumer what having a spine actually looks and sounds like. Anyone who thinks this woman is wrong for the Speaker's job is buying into bullshit. She is the perfect person to go against the know-nothing blowhard currently occupying the Oval Office. The only thing is she didn't go for is the absolute drop-the-mic moment: "Mr. President, why are we asking the American taxpayer for anything toward a wall when you promised Mexico would pay for it?". She cut him to shreds, but left him breathing. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Get over the Pelosi propaganda that's supposed to be dividing the left (and succeeding to some degree). She may be establishment, you may not agree with her 100% of the time, but she's the kind of connected, ballsy operator you want right now. It's OK.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >Trump: OK, let me ask you this, just -- and we're doing this in a very friendly manner.

Don't you love it when someone is arguing with you, but stops to let you know they're doing it in a friendl manner. Donald trump is a nice fucking guy. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Muthafuckas act like you forgot about Nancy. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer dropped down the street to the White House to have a chat with the president*

I love that they used the asterisk. Democrats should pass a law after 2020, than anyone referring to ex Donald as president MUST use the asterisk ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It may be her office soon.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ How do you like her now ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Today was the day Pelosi truly became President.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I loved this meeting. There should be more of them in the public eye! 

Next episode. 

Chuck Schumer: Mr President, we will agree to fund your border wall as soon as Mr Deez signs the paperwork. 

Pence...

Trump: Who’s Deez?

Schumer and Pelosi in unison: THESE NUTS!

Pence... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is still reality TV for him. Too bad there's no multiple-takes and clever post-production.  We get the raw feed.  Idiot ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Bernie voter here (I ran for office on his ticket) Nancy is a beast and I want her to be interim President until January 2021. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >PELOSI: OK, then do it. Then do it.

I like Nancy ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ *Smocked.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ She has the confidence.

That’s why Trump was endorsing her. He was trying to break up the party by manipulating democrats to think that it was time for a change. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pelosi was never the one I was worried about selling out. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Aw man, that's fucking great. Go Pelosi! I see why the GOP hates her so much.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ president* ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ \*smocked ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is slightly random, but its kinda funny to see Chuck/Nancy calling him Mr.President and him calling them by their first name. Is that how its supposed to be? Holy power imbalance

&#x200B;

EDIT: That's not how its supposed to be. Pelosi called Chuck "Mr. Schumer" and the press called her "Madam Secretary".  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Did she tease him about his tiny wiener ? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ [OG](https://i.imgur.com/oUfdwoO.jpg) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Soon to be Madam President Nancy Pelosi had some huge balls today.  Well played.  The best part was when she says, "Go do it!" after Trump says he can get the votes. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump picking Pence ended up being an actual (probably accidental) stroke of genius. He’s the only guy every Repub could agree would make a fine VP, but is also creepy and strange enough that liberals would be scared to let him be president.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I think you misspelled **moke** ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Rage tweeting tomorrow from individual-1. 

What an insecure baby.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This was so telling in a lot of ways. It was the classic tactic of standing up to a bully, and watching him melt. They knew they could say anything they wanted, and Trump would just flounder and do his schtick. They then took turns baiting him into giving them sound bites for 2020, and all the leverage they need to ask for everything including the kitchen sink. If they don't get it, they simply say "Well he said he wanted to shut down the government..." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "But she bothers to make a living and isn't a freegan! The Speeches! Look at the speeches!" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ She SMOCKED his ass. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Imo this whole government shutdown crap is nothing but a tactic by Trump to distract from the Mueller stuff. 

He knows he doesn't have the votes for his pointless clown wall, but the press will talk about it more instead of focusing mostly on Mueller. 

I expect his statements to get crazier the closer Mueller gets to him or his sons. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump at the beginning taking offense to Pelosi calling it his government shutdown.

Trump at the end proudly taking ownership of the shutdown.

Such awkward poetry in motion :) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pence didn't say anything the entire interview, and didn't even change facial expressions the entire time. He was even more robotic than usual. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Charlie Pierce is a goddamn national treasure.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Bitch slapped by an elderly lady.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ How could they not call him out on his lies about 10 terrorist??? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Actually she kept asking to end the public performance in favor of negotiating behind closed doors.  Why would she not want trump to show his ass in front of the press corps for as long as possible?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why didn't either of these asshat Dems say 'we thought Mexico was paying for the wall...didn't you explain that numerous times over the course of your campaign? '

Just one time. Someone call him on his shit. One..damn....time ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ She said afterwards she didn't want to embarrass him on camera. No, you should embarrass him on camera, as much as you can.  What have you been doing the last 2 years? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Jeez, that video is about as cringe worthy as it gets. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He has that oh shit look on his face. Homer Simpson.  “Brain - Don’t say I’ll shut down the government”. Doh! I said I’ll shut down the government.  Stupid brain... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And Republicans actually admire Trump.  Can you believe it?! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ She's an effective legislator. You can hate her or whatever but there's a reason she's elected as leader. It's because she is really good at it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No, she's still a massive sellout.  The US vs THEM of DC politics is part of the game that has to be played so that people like you will go on thinking Our Team™ are the Good Guys^© and Their Team are Up To No Good^®.

Under Pelosi, the Dems have consistently passed or helped Republicans pass corporate giveaways.  You just ignore that, instead focusing on this meaningless theater.  And they'll keep on doing it so long as you fall for tough talk when they're busy violating all your principles. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is political theater. Both candidates were FOR a Wall/barrier.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlFi0QUboxs

So instead of fighting for a living wage, or to get out of the wars, or for Healthcare or education. The establishment Dems are gonna pretend that their own platform didn't include a wall/Barrier. To avoid fighting for the workers. LAME.

How about we offer the extra barrier funding in exchange for living wage, or public option healthcare?
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ you can still be a neoliberal corporate sellout and hate a fascist ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Mr Trump, I don't care if you see this as shoving this down your throat... or shoving it up your ass.  


This issue is decided and the answer is No.  Sound it it.   Get used to it. 


And if you or any of your cabinet members wants 10 cents more for airfare or BS golf outtings, You Better Put That Shit on your Personal VISA.  


The Free Ride for Scumbag Republicans is OVER...!  Now, GTF out of here... or do I need to spit in your face for the cameras too...?" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Being anti-Trump isn't Progressive, it's being a decent human being. Every politician should be standing up to him like that. That does not prove anything for or against how progressive she is. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ She’s a sellout to the people not trump... she’s still a sellout and nothing these people do changes anything on my block.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ uh. is this a joke?
mocking trump does not make you a fucking liberal 
championing liberal policy makes you a liberal.  Mocking trump just makes you a human, and maybe a sucker for an easy target

honestly. fuck off ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ she can mock him all she wants but at the end of the day she will be all for rich people getting tax breaks.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What a stupid title. Fucking James Comey mocks President Trump. That doesn't make him a progressive.

People call Pelosi a sellout because she takes corporate money but peddles herself as a progressive. I think it's more nuanced than that, and that she's genuinely a decent person that needs to help the next-generation become as strong as her before she transitions out. But what a fucking stupid title. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm no fan of Trump.. so in the context of this article, Trump acknowledges "I have the house, I don't have the senate votes". That seems true. Maybe I'm missing something.. did he say earlier that he did have the 60? Is the enthusiasm here just out of Pelosi bullying him in principle? Seems like he's being fairly transparent about his options. Is this article just a general "screw Trump cause he's Trump" article? Again, I don't like the guy but it makes sense not to introduce something if he knows it won't get the votes. Is the media reaching for a "just mocked to his face" headline moment? If this was a screenwriting exercise, I'm still looking for the scene's punchline.. excuse my possible ignorance ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ My first impression is Trump does not understand how to negotiate from any position other than trying to appear to overpower his opponent. 

The other impression I got is that Schumer is in over his head. He was making weird comments, cutting off pelosi (who was handling the situation extremely well), and he kept turning to the camera and the press which made it look very disingenuous. Schumer is going to be an achilles heel for Dems.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Holy cow its time for Pelosi and Schumer to be replaced. As much I respect their work, its pretty clear they are frail in their age, especially Pelosi.  Democrats will be a sad party if they can't get some younger blood into leadership positions ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No, Pelosi is a liberal sellout.
It doesnt take much to talk shit about Donald Trump.
Just look at how she votes and what her policies are. Actions speak louder than words. She's just Republican-lite.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I can’t figure out what the asterisk is for. Anybody got the goods? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Words are easy we will see if she's a sellout when it comes to actions. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ ...resisting Trump is the bare minimum I expect from his political opposition. It is not a liberal bonafide. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ To be frank, she did come off as transparently political.. so while she may have scored some points with the resistance crowd, I found the exchange to be weak on all sides. 

These are supposed to be our leaders, and none of them are leading. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What the hell?

Whether or not you stand up to the Crybaby-in-Chief doesn’t make you a sellout, it’s your policy agenda (or lack thereof). It’s easy to mock Trump - if you have the courage - but when it’s time to set a legislative agenda, that’s when things get murky. 

That title is fucking disingenuous.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "So much for the Liberal Sellout."

No shitty website articles you don't decide that, the people do.

However good on her for having a spine today, albeit it's only when Trump is literally on the verge of total failure, better late than never.

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Esquire is filling the Gawker void.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I sure hope all of these old Dianosores leave the office one day.. We need the young generation to stand up and make things right and better. These old farts are set and only care about their pockets. They only have few years left on the earth, some maybe-couple of years. This is why we have so many problems....

\\ ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ she can till be sellout to corporations, which she is.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ She legitimizes him already by going to his office to talk with him.  The idea that she "won" just because she said a bunch of words that won't change the balance of power in any way is pernicious.

This is the problem with Democrats, they confuse self-righteousness with "winning." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pelosi gets to act tough and stand up to him. Trump gets to rile up his base and stay true to the wall. All televised. Convince me this wasn’t entirely staged ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I would love it if she became President someday, it would make me happy!  Maybe she can make Shumer her VP! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What a horrible title, as if making fun of Trump really gets anyone but surface level goons invested. Keeping up appearances as the opposition party while capitulating to the most bloodthirsty and plutocratic shit? Wow, liberals love her! ~end~

  ~cmt~ exactly when did Trump have the high ground?

ever ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >It was an extraordinary moment when Trump not only lost the high ground as president but made Democrats look like the grown-ups...

Lost the high ground? Like he ever had it. Give me a break. 

And my grandchildren look and act more like grownups than Cadet Bonespurs ever has.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I was banned from r/conservatives for posting this exact comment

“Yeah there’s a lot of space in there”, in response to a comment “I can’t imagine what’s going on in Trump’s head”. What a bunch of fucking pussies. They are an exact mirror of everything Trump.  No outside thoughts, news, or opinions welcome. I’m posting this in every thread, to inform people what a joke these people and their subreddit is.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I bet his depraved base loved it ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "You were supposed to drain the swamp, not join it!" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The Democrats have been the grown ups this entire time. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You know your Politics have gone to shit when being the “grown up” is a win. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Implying he had it to begin with.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He never had the high ground...he's not Obi-Wan Kenobi. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Having the corpse of Mike Pence as his tag-team partner didn't help Trump very much today. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I see the conservative spin on this is to pretend this obese amoral piece of shit has ever had high ground in his life. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "From my point of view the Democrats are evil!" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "lost the high ground" ?!? LOL! Trump's always been in the gutter. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why did Nancy and Chuck try to keep Trump from making a fool of himself in front of the cameras by suggesting they conclude their talks in private?  Let Trump show the world what a tool he truly is!  If you ever read a full transcript of one of Trump’s speeches, you will see that Trump rambles incoherently most of the time.  What we see on TV are the few coherent comments that he makes.  Let his base see him in his true form.  The man is unhinged and should not be running this country! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The [original piece](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/11/trump-has-already-lost-shutdown-fight/?utm_term=.b6ed0a92d376) by Jennifer Rubin was a better read than this re-tread of it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >People do not yet realize how much of the Wall, including really effective renovation, has already been built. 

If that were true this fucker would be posting videos and pics of the wall constantly. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's actually painful to watch. Trump automatically lowers the level of consciousness of anyone in the room with him. I'm surprised Pelosi and Schumer held it together as well as they did. I think people are so assaulted by Trump's awfulness that their knee-jerk response is to get down in the mud and wrestle with him. This interview shows his toxicity at such a visceral level, I don't know how he anyone can spend a minute alone with him.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Please. The Deepwater Horizon was higher ground than the swamp that cork up the asshole of human progress wallows in. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That's because we are and have been the grown-ups for some time, now. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Spoiler alert. He never had the high ground. If there's a low road to take, he'll find a way to tunnel underneath it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Chuck: Its over I have the high ground! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He had about as much high ground as Anakin did. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That's easy. Democrats *are* the grownups. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-lost-high-ground-and-made-democrats-look-grown-ups-conservative-1254731) reduced by 79%. (I'm a bot)

  ~cmt~ Today is the day Nancy Pelosi became presidential 


p.s. I think today is the day Mike Pence became the tin man. I swear I heard his whispering “oil” “oil” when he was sitting there in silence  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ General Pelosi: It's over, Donald!  I have the high ground!

Trump: You underestimate my bigotry! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The only time the orange baboon seemed to have the high ground was when he was standing on a pile of his own shit and flinging it at everyone, causing them to duck and cover. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Lost it?  When the fuck did he have it? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Lol, like that matters. High ground means nothing and the left shouldn’t worry about it, you have to embarrass this clown and reject him at every turn to energize your base for 2020 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~  “It is not clear how Trump could have appeared any more irrational and unhinged.”

Oh, come on.  In 2 weeks we’re going to look back and think this wasn’t shit.  He’ll find new and interesting ways of looking more unhinged that will make today look normal.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~  **‘Made Democrats Look Like the Grown-ups,’** 

This is who Trump is as a human being, which hasn't changed since he started campaigning. I'm not shocked at Trump's exchange because I've watched his rallies.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That was the point. That was why Chuck and Nancy were trying to provoke him in the first place. He's just not clever enough not to take the bait. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I don't like Trump. He's coarse and rough and irritating and he gets everywhere.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He had the high ground? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I was unaware that he ever had the high ground.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ There is no high ground when rock bottom is 10000 feet above you.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It always confuses me when Conservatives act like Trump is breaking new low ground - his positions are the same as theirs, he is just a lot more brash and open in saying them. The place Trumo pitches his ideological tent is in the same place most Conservatives have been camping for decades, he just shouts and sings as he sets it up. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump held his own reality show in the White House today and still lost. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump didn't make Dems look like grownups. They were the only grownups in the room. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's amusing that donald (and I heard Sen Kennedy parrot) that 'there's no point in passing the funding bill in the house becuase we don't have the votes in the senate.'

They had no problem doing that dozens of times when it came to ACA repeal. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What's with the recent Jennifer Rubin PR tour by NewsWeek?

She's a fraud like Flake. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Sounds like an encouraging headline, but Jennifer Rubin being anti-Trump is hardly noteworthy. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Respectability politics are bad anyway. Politely saying, “fuck the poor” is still a terrible policy, no matter how nice you make it sound. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wait, Jennifer Rubin is a conservative columnist? I feel like I've read plenty of pieces by her that ripped Trump ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yeah by putting them in the same room together. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's over, Trump! I have the high ground!  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Nobody gave a rat's ass about a wall until Donnie figured it played well to get out the racist vote.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Democrats: We have the high ground trump. It’s over.

Trump: Do you underestimate my power? 

We all know how that ends.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Only high ground Trump had was standing on a huge pile of bullshit
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's treason, then. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ When did he have "the high ground"? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ How would I go about reposting this in r/prequelmemes ? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is like Revenge of the Sith and the Dark side lied to themselves that Anakin had the high ground.  The right/evil people are not very smart.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I prefer that he looked like a child  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ https://twitter.com/PaulLeeTicks/status/1072596513417781249 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm not sure his base will see it that way. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's over, Trump! I have the high ground! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Grown-ups is a word children use. I think “Adults” was the word they were looking for! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Where in the world did the characterization of Jennifer Rubin as a "conservative columnist" come from?  I've read a pile of her stuff over years and she's consistently heckled Trump and Republicans.  None of what she's said has impressed me as conservative. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Kinda. Schumer was still a pussy though. He should have brought up that he said Mexico was going to pay and that 7 in 10 Americans don’t want the wall.

Instead of confronting him, he said that stuff to the press afterwards instead of to his face ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Obi-Wan likes this. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It’s always Rubin when Newsweek quotes a conservative against trump. Rubin, of course, isn’t wrong— but they should just name her. She’s not Joe Shmoe next door neighbor.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Lost the high ground??????? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Applies to basically everything he does.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You can’t lose something you never had.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump has never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever had the high ground. What the fuck-fuck? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Is this from April 2017?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well I say we get rid of every single neoliberal out there 🔥🔥🔥🔥 ~end~

TLDR: Google users think Donald Trump is an idiot, so our database associates the word with pictures of him. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ *Steve Chabot, a Republican from Ohio, said that he needed to go to the third or fourth page of search results to find positive coverage of the Affordable Care Act repeal bill. "You had to go deep into the search results," Chabot said. "I know Google's attitude, the algorithm made us do it, I don't know if I buy that."* 

That's because there was nothing positive to cover, you schmuck! Only 17% of the country liked your repeal shenanigans, Google search results reflect that "popularity". Same shenanigans is why 40 seats will be seating a Dem in January btw. ~end~

"You had to go deep into the search results," Chabot said. "I know Google's attitude, the algorithm made us do it, I don't know if I buy that." 

You mean the bill that never passed? ACA is still largely the law of the land despite numerous Republican attempts to sabotage it and drive up costs due to market destabilization and uncertainty.  

Maybe that is why it is hard to find positive coverage on it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >Steve Chabot, a Republican from Ohio, said that he needed to go to the third or fourth page of search results to find positive coverage of the Affordable Care Act repeal bill. 

"Why do I have to get to the 3rd or 4th page before I finally see an article from the Daily Caller on why the ACA repeal will be amazing?!? God damn bill had a 16% approval rating for god's sake, you liberal tech people are so blatantly biased." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ When you Google "idiot," 35 of the first 60 images are of Donald Trump, and one is of his two sons.

  ~cmt~ Google handles site rank the way it SHOULD be handled: An algorithm that determines how relevant a result is.

Instead, these idiots want it to handle things the way the "mainstream media" handles controversy: Give equal weight to both sides, no matter how insignificant and whack one of the sides is.

&#x200B; ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What a waste of time. Here you have the CEO of one of the world's most influential tech companies trying to explain to a room full of old men how the internet works. Worst part is, most of them probably don't even understand what he's saying or care to, they just want to grandstand for the people stupid enough to vote for them. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The thing that Republicans don't get, is that the younger generation is more liberal than conservative.  That's why searches show 45 when lookup idiot.  It's also why the Obama care repeal bill doesn't show up.  This also explains why Fox news leads in viewership, cause all the old Republicans only watch TV and check up on their grand kids on Facebook.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So basically Republicans are wanting a "fairness doctrine" for the Internet.

Think about that for a moment.
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Congressman saying they had to search through multiple pages of results to find positive coverage of the ACA repeal..... might have something to do with that being a small & elite minority interest and the large majority of people don’t see the repeal as positive  ~end~

  ~cmt~ > Things like relevance, freshness, popularity, **how other people are using it**, and based on that, at any given time we try to rank and find the best results for that query. 

So it's because Trump and idiot are often used in the same sentence by most people. Makes perfect sense....also relevance ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The poor Republicans are angry, really angry, very very angry.

And they are ordering google to change the search results so that nothing bad about any Republican ever surfaces in a search.

Only Democrats and liberals should ever show up as undesirable, never a Republican or conservative.  ~end~

FEEL FACTS! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I wish the Google exec would have summed up his argument — “Google isn’t structured to determine that Trump is an idiot. It’s just reflecting the fact that most people *think* he’s an idiot. Would anyone like to discuss why people think that? I have all day...” ~end~

"Well Senator, this is a speculative answer, but there's a large number of inputs that go into our algorithm.  How often something appears on the web, how big the news sources are, how often users click on it, etc

"So if Google is associating Trump and Idiot, that's not because we made a choice to associate those two.  It means there are a large number of pages which associate the terms Trump and Idiot.  Or it might reference the fact that large news outlets reported on John Kelly calling Trump an Idiot.  Or it could be that users keep clicking on stories which call Trump an Idiot, or at a meta level, there are stories reported on the association of Trump and Idiot.

"We do not make an effort to unassociated these terms because they reflect the state of the web.  When you search Idiot you get Trump, because there's a lot of content which associates Trump with the word Idiot.

"How much more would you like me to explain this?  I can keep saying the words Trump and Idiot together, as many times as you like."

  ~cmt~ > "You had to go deep into the search results," Chabot said. "I know Google's attitude, 'The algorithm made us do it,' but I don't know that I buy that." 

There's nothing to "buy". They don't understand how modern tech works. And they don't seem to understand that their own brains are by far the most biased and delusional systems on Earth right now, far more biased and abused than search engine algorithms. ~end~

"You had to go deep into the search results," Chabot said. "I know Google's attitude, the algorithm made us do it, I don't know if I buy that."

Here you have a prime example of the attitude of conservatives. If all the top search results for ACA repeal are negative they don't even consider that the repeal must be unpopular (hint: it is). They just assume it's Google fudging results to make it seem like ACA repeal is unpopular. They want to search results to *"both sides"* everything. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > to find positive coverage of the Affordable Care Act repeal bill. "You had to go deep into the search results," Chabot said. "I know Google's attitude, the algorithm made us do it, I don't know if I buy that."

That's great that you don't buy it. Doesn't mean you are not ignorant and have no idea what you're talking about. How about facing reality that your policies are unpopular and then changing them to better serve the people?

Or will your lobbyists not let you do that?

  ~cmt~ Q: Why do I get a picture of Trump when I Google "idiot"?

A: Because he is an idiot. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So assuming for the sake of argument Republicans are correct that Google is manipulating results:

* Are the Republicans suggesting that private companies do not have the right to free speech - careful now recall your money flow relies on Citizens United which gave corporations free speech. 

* Are Republicans, given their argument that Google is staffed by all liberals, trying to argue that liberals should not be allowed jobs? Are they suggesting that political party should be a protected class and if so they can show Google is biased against conservatives in the hiring process - do application or interview questions and Google identifying conservatives to not hire? 

* Are Republicans trying to criminalize the expression of political opinion by people who don't agree with them? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The fact that the first thing the republicans think(or don’t) when they  see bad news is that they are working for the other side tells you all you have to know about fox. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ooh I can answer this one! It's because Donald Trump is an idiot.  ~end~

  ~cmt~ The search results are based from worldwide searches right? If so do they honestly think the rest of the world doesn't see him like that? lol ~end~

  ~cmt~ narrator: "Because he's an idiot"  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why trump shows up when you enter 'idiot'?

Cause he's an idiot  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So the party that always pontificates about "the free marketplace of ideas" is suddenly upset that popular ideas disagree with them. It's almost as though they don't care about free speech and the free transfer of ideas and only want to force their idiocy on other people!  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's not just Google. DuckDuckGo and Bing also show pictures of Trump when doing image searches for "idiot". ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I love that with them bring this out into the light, way more people will do a search just to test it and that will solidify it that much more. Donald, congrats, your famous buddy! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's difficult to find positive stories about negative actions. Film at 11. ~end~

So...he had to go digging to find any *positive* coverage of the *nasty* bill designed to take away affordable health care from US citizens? I’d like to sit this idiot down with stacks of newspapers from all over the country, and all over the world, and watch him try to flesh out all of the *positive* articles written on the subject. Same thing, dufus. Learn to Internet. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You can also look up asshole and his picture is all over it. I say let him own it. ~end~

> Lofgren followed up: "So it's not some little man sitting behind the curtain figuring out what we're going to show the user, it's basically a compilation of what users are generating and trying to sort through that information."

Or, to put it more plainly: Trump shows up when you search for "idiot", because users and content creators associate him with the term. So the inference is that everything is working properly. You're seeing a good example of what you searched for. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If that kind of basic stuff is what they're opening with it's going to be reallll long hearing ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Would  have loved it if Pichai had just said:

> Because he's a **_fucking_** idiot! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The future is now, old man.  We need term limits for these idiots.  They are so completely out of touch with the world they govern.

OK, here is my take on how a search engine works.  I'm 33 and have a MFA.  I grew up with the internet, and I understand programming very lightly.  I will probably be corrected and that's fine.

You search for a term and Google does it's best based on indexes to deliver a result.

Change for these results occurs when the user clicks on something Google wasn't expecting.

If I search APPLE, and go to images, and the first entire page is oranges... well, all those results are wrong. (According to me, but not according to Google.)

I press NEXT and on Page2 I find an apple and click it.  This was the result I wanted, and Google **KNOWS** I clicked this.  They know I clicked next, they know the image I expanded.  Google uses that information to change their search results.  This image was primarily red, and it was embedded in an article that talks about apples, and the word orange was never used.

Over time, *users* are the ones to determine what shows up on search results.  If enough people search for Apples and they need to drop down to page 2 or 3 to find pictures of Apples, eventually the algorithm will self correct, because Google's priority is serving results as fast as possible.  They will lose users if finding something takes 60 seconds or more.  There **are** competitors out there. 

Anyway, Trump showing up when searching for the word "Idiot" is indeed search result manipulation, but it wasn't controlled by Google.  It was controlled by Google's users.  This trend started when someone searched for the word Idiot and found Trump on page... 73 or something.  Over time those trends go up.. whether Trump's image is associated with a news article that uses the word Idiot a lot, or forum posts... whatever.  ***SOMEHOW*** Google figured out that Trump is associated with the word Idiot, and furthrmore, users are rewarding Google by clicking on images of "Idiot" featuring his face.

What does that say about us?  Is this a ploy by some internet trolls?  Maybe -- but maybe Trump is a fucking idiot, and that< phrase keeps getting repeated on more places than just reddit.  Did I just manipulate a search engine?  Arguably everything we do manipulates search engines.  Does anyone remember the Semen Tanks troll on reddit like 7 years ago?  The TLDR is some guy complained about advertisements for Semen Tanks were showing up on his videos, and he went on to explain the issue and used the word "Semen Tanks" like three dozen times in his post.  A week later, another self post was made and apparently a ton of redditors said that Google scraped their browse history and saw tons of mentions of Semen Tanks which also manipulated the ads they were served -- DUE TO THAT POST.

TLDR: Search results are a snapshot of search engine users.

  ~cmt~ Based on the arguments and the way the GOP speak on the matter, it sounds like they want a forced "equal" sort of system lol. Best part of this is that by having this discussion, and bringing up the "idiot", all they did was make the search result more widespread.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I would just like to point out that now that people have started reporting on this **Trump makes almost the entire front page when searching for "idiot"** and most of the images are associated with articles about how Trump shows up when you search "idiot." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Oh, I think we know why.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "I had  to scroll down to 3rd or 4th page to find positive coverage of repealing the ACA"  unbelievable that positive coverage made it that far up the search results. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This strategy the GOP is using will only work against the old and technology illiterate.

Most young people know how this works, so any young alt-right Trump supporters are going to be scratching their heads.

They won't be able to defend this. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Well, you see.."  ~end~

  ~cmt~ Wait, do conservatives think that someone is on the end of the however many billion searches that are made every day, choosing results and getting them to you in under a second?

Like they saw the sketch about if Google was a person and thought "yeah that's probably how it really works".   ~end~

WTF? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What's hilarious is that this story will make that search result even higher. Every time someone says Trump is a fucking idiot, it increases the weight that Google gives to fucking idiot. So one would guess Trump is a fucking idiot.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Just like women's health, if you don't understand how it works, you have no business passing legislation around it. ~end~

"Steve Chabot, a Republican from Ohio, said he needed to go to the third or fourth page of search results to find positive coverage of the bill introduced last year to repeal the Affordable Care Act."

Uh maybe because it wasn't that popular? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I think the real takeaway from this article is that only 15% of all searches are new and original searches, which means when you google "Donald Trump buttfuck abracadabra cookie monster" there's a good chance you're not the first. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Simple answer: Because Donald Trump is an idiot. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ People from Google had to take time out of their busy day to go explain how search engines work...

&#x200B;

WTF? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Because it's accurate?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Because.... He's an idiot. I knew this without a Google search. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I love how they made a bigger deal out of it and now it's cemented even harder into the algorithm or whatever. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I expect there will be a lot more pictures of Trump when you search for “idiot” thanks to articles like this one.

Keep up the good work, Internet!   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Huh, I got Trumps with some green day sprinkled in. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Do you think republicans are gonna burn there google now? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > You had to go deep into the search results," Chabot said. "I know Google's attitude, 'The algorithm made us do it,' but I don't know that I buy that." 

Here is the thing, Steve Chabot, this algorithm doesn't give a shit about how you FEEL.  It is based on reality that you and I occupy.  If you are upset at negative news or coverage, then STOP doing negative SHIT! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ironically, since Trump helped give net neutrality the boot, if Google was altering its search results, they’d be completely allowed to do so.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Can we get his face to appear in the dictionary entry for "idiot" as well? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Just as a fact, every single day, 15% of the searches Google sees, we have never seen them before," 

This is the most interesting thing from today personally, that's way higher than I thought.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Steve Chabot, a Republican from Ohio, said he needed to go to the third or fourth page of search results to find positive coverage of the bill introduced last year to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

What a fucking maroon  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I thought it was just because Donald was an idiot. Wow, you learn something everyday.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So I think this warrants a change in the dictionary.  The word "idiot" is now forever linked to trump.  I just googled idiot and it goes directly to trump.  Perfect. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Google is an independent corporation, and requires no government license or approval to express its opinions. (see Citizens United)

Even if Google DID manipulate the results on its page, they have a complete right to do so.

It doesn't use the public airways, and has no legal obligation to be unbiased.

On the other hand, Fox News, operates under a license from the gov't, and is given a monopoly over a piece of the electromagnetic spectrum. 

If ANY organization has an obligation to be fair, Fox would certainly be the one to do so.

Can anyone argue that Fox is not a totally biased propaganda arm of a political party and the ruling administration?

Why hasn't this republican Congress addressed the blatant bias of this organization that is actually licensed by the government? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ and the fact that it had to be explained to these people shows us exactly how screwed we are when these very people are the ones that make laws regarding computers and the internet. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Reality has a liberal bias.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well, you see, it turns out a number of people who use Google, as in internationally, associate the word ‘idiot’ with Individual 1. Additionally, many people who use Google also disapprove of the ACA’s repeal. You don’t have to be American to think either of those things... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Because Google is very accurate? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'll take, "Because he's an idiot for $10M," please, Alex. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ TLDR: It's because he's and idiot.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ For anybody who doesn't understand why this is the case: Google isn't curating the search results. They are returning results based on how people use the word on the Internet. In this case, there are a lot of web pages out there writing that Trump is an idiot, so that's what the Google algorithm learns. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Image Search results

"genius": Einstein is a common image, but Trump "very stable genius" is there

"dictator":  Hilter, Stalin, Qaddafi, and Kim Jong Un all show up before Trump.

"tyrant": Tump is first nonfiction result

"asshole": Trump is #1

&#x200B;

Google obviously has a reality bias ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What a waste of a good opportunity to get answers on privacy. They could have followed any of those image links to get an answer, all of them are now news articles ABOUT Trump's "idot" result. Meanwhile I get served ads based on conversations I've had near my phone.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Tl;dr - it’s because he’s an idiot. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Angry republicans hold meeting to ask why reality has a liberal bias. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wait, Trump's Meme Warriors don't know that one? They've been abusing this for years. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And because of that question, "Trump" and "Idiot" are going to be even more relevant now. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Can confirm he does not appear on a search for “genius” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Because Trump is an idiot. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Some context for y'all:

In 1972, Nixon signs the Clean Water Act, which basically establishes that is the job of the Federal Gov to ensure that Americans have access to clean drinking water and to protect water bodies from runaway pollution. 

In 1989, GHWB issues an executive order known as the "No Net Loss Wetlands" policy (NNLWP), which is a far reaching policy to ensure that any wetlands loss is offset by making new wetlands. 

In 2015, the Obama EPA further clarifies the NNLWP using what's known as the "Waters of the United States" (WOTUS) designation to further define what qualifies as a federally protected wetlands, and in doing so establishes that temporary ditches, ponds, or other water bodies that are tributary to larger bodies of water--even if they are seasonal, ephemeral, and wholly contained within private property--are considered federally protected waters. WOTUS ruling roils farmers, land developers, golf course owners, because it (1) subjects property owners to a permitting process that ensures that they are managing their run off (which is the main source of nutrient pollution in surface water bodies), (2) disallows land owners from managing their "federally protected wetlands" in ways that they see fit. 

The trump EPA policy position is to revert to the pre-Obama definition of what is a federally protected water body, which serves the interests of Big Ag and developers, mostly. 

The problem with today's news is that water, whether surface OR groundwater flows can't read parcel maps. Water is going to flow wherever it is going to flow, and if it's full of a bunch of nitrogen or other pollutants, it's going to take the dirty stuff with it.  ~end~

  ~cmt~ What a shitty president.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Whenever I'm explaining Trump's stupid repeal of common-sense regulations in areas that others might not be so familiar with (e.g. consumer finance protection, repealing parts of Dodd-Frank, etc), I always use "Clean Water" as an example of a regulation that's "good" and how some sort of disaster led us to implement it in the first place, how the cost to society is obviously far greater than whatever minimal economic impact would happen if you overturn it, etc.

I should have known it was only a matter of time before Trump started repealing the literal Clean Water Act. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ How are regulations like this just repealed? It is  a huge hurdle to even get stuff into the register. There are hearings and studies, and everything.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is a really misleading and alarmist title. Per the article (emphasis mine):

>The Environmental Protection Agency **unveiled a proposal** redefining US waters under the Clean Water Act.

>Farm and agriculture lobbyists have pushed for these changes since 2015.

>But environmentalists say they could result in contaminating millions of acres of waters with pesticides and other agricultural pollutants.

>The proposal seeks to remove protections on "ephemeral streams" - which only appear after rainfall - and wetlands not directly connected or adjacent to large bodies of water.

>**The replacement regulation would not change protections for large bodies of water and neighbouring wetlands, and any state-imposed rules will also be unaffected.**

TL;DR -- This is simply a *proposal* and not an actual rollback. And even if these changes *were* to pass, they would only eliminate fairly recent regulations and not the entire Clean Water Act. The President can't do that, even if he wanted to. It's still concerning that the President wants to move backwards, but this isn't as dire as the headline would have you think.

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ask Flint about the "the clean water act " ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump can't roll back the Obama era land grab because it was never allowed to go into effect, it was blocked for the entirety of Obama's years since he attempted it, then delayed by Trump until the attempt could be rescinded entirely. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ IIT: a bunch of fools that only read the headline, and miss the fact that the article itself undermines the claim. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Two 6 Million Dollar Men patrol the border!  What more do you libruls want!? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Maybe they can't find enough sociopaths since the GOP have hired them all? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I’m as down to be outraged at stuff as the next guy but in this case without seeing the contract it’s impossible to know if what was delivered is fair for the price. Sometimes with consulting contracts there’s also a budget allocated to staffing designing a process that will govern the outcomes in addition to just paying for what’s delivered. With that said it’s possible that this was a huge waste of money but without seeing the actual statement of work I would recommend not jumping to conclusions. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Most recruiting firms work for free until the place a candidate... Why the fuck they paying up front without results? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Very cool and very legal 😎👍 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Now now, let's not be hasty.  Maybe they're actually really good and doing thorough background checks and psych evals on applicants and so far only 2 people that aren't howling, raging xenopaths have applied? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Expert marketer and artful deal maker Trump fails yet again.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Sounds like Melania's friend getting the food for Puerto Rico scam all over again.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Only hiring the best people! Guess these results either mean the people applying aren’t great, or this firm is just a bunch of grifters. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ * **CRIME:** #2842 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Maybe they're just taking their time, looking for the best people, the biggliest, Oh, they're gonna be so great, I have to tell you and people are saying it, people are talking about it, it's really something, like you wouldn't believe. ~end~

> President Donald Trump has sought since his first week in office to dramatically ramp up hiring within his administration&#039;s two key immigration-enforcement agencies: Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

  ~cmt~ We're all idiots for not pulling this scan first.. Or we're just genuinely moral.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I wish I made that much money while being as equally incompetent and unwilling to do my job. =/ ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I have been getting emails from indeed about border patrol jobs. A job that would not make sense with my resume  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This should be much higher ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Sure smells like more Trump Swamp. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Dear US House of Representatives. This is a made for TV hearing. All Democrats and Independents will be interested in knowing more about this.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Are they the same two employees that were sent to Puerto Rico to repair the power? I’m sure that company made more than $13.6 billion and were as effective as 2 more border patrol agents will be.  What a sham.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I’d laugh but, this is honestly just depressing at this point. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The incompetence and corruption of this administration is unparalleled  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The fraud, waste and abuse from this administration is staggering.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Bet it’s owned by Erik Prince or one of Stinky Zinke or Boy Jared’s chums ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Money laundering, perhaps?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Accenture is a public company run by very reputable leaders. If Accenture was to take in 13.6 million it’d about a penny into the pocket of every employee and stake holder (if that) so I don’t think there’s foul play here  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It can't be that hard to find sex offenders who are also racist can it?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ America only has 2 borders. What's the problem?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I was wondering why I was seeing ads for these jobs when I live thousands of miles from the border. This makes sense though ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Graft?! In the Trump administration?! How shocking! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I want to believe its less about incompetence and more about no decent people wanting to do the job, but I know that's not the case.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I don't get surprised about any of this Trump bullshit anymore ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ maybe he was just paying them for their loyalty, he said he was going to take care of people who donated to his campaign, he said so publicly on the campaign trail why people mad? thives gonna thive. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It cost a average of $50k to train a U.S soldier. Soo yea, where is all that money? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Must be some damn good agents. Are they from Krypton or something? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Looks like the 6 Million Dollar Man project went over budget. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This title is lacking. What did the administration ACTUALLY pay them for?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I give you unbridled capitalism, ladies and gentlemen.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Were they both hired on a lifetime contract of $6,800,000? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What's that he says about the investigation into him being 'extremely expensive'? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Unless they hired Robocop as one of the two, it wasn’t worth the money. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ To be fair, the ratio I’ve heard is it takes 100 applicants to get two good hires. 

Still doesn’t cost 13.6M to process 200 resumes though. Maybe $13.6k including interviews and stuff.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Fiscal responsibility ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ very free much market ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He would have hired the  caravan for free.   Benefits they already speak  the language.  Are experienced in border crossing.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ At more than 6 million a piece that's a real bargain. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ $13.6 million isnt enough for thousands of workers anyways.  
  
If we assume each agent makes 30k a year they only have enough money for 453 agents. That's without any other costs.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The two people hired was probably just one person with 3 three names. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Most of the border is swamp-free, except that it isn't. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Shades of [Puerto Rico](https://newrepublic.com/minutes/145540/fishy-contract-rebuild-puerto-ricos-electric-grid-now-bona-fide-scandal) huh. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ To be fair, I'd rather spend money to do nothing than hire money to further militarize the border. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Application thru offer process generally takes more than a year, so I don’t know why this is surprising to anyone. A lot of paperwork, complacency test, background checks, physical & medical tests, interviews, polygraph, etc have to be passed prior to the academy. That’s something like 16 weeks in itself. 

I went thru the process about 7-8 years ago, but had to decline due to a family situation. 

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ten months in contract ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ “We’re hiring only the best people for our border. We found the best two agents you’ve ever seen folks. We know because they cost us $14 million to hire. They said ‘14 million’ and I said WOW, they must be really great with a price tag like that, and 14 million isn’t much compared to the CRAZY 750 billion dollar defense budget. Anyways, I told them NO COLLUSION and that 14 million dollars was just a simple private transaction.” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Obviously funneling money into yet another pocket. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Two, huh?   
Lemmeguess: Don Jr. and Eric Trump? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's almost as if the government sucks ass ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ They also created the problem with the hiring freeze. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What's that, 6.8 million a year? Good work if you can get it... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Can i get in on that deal? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Money well spent! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What a bunch of fucking losers.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ 2 hires in 10 months, for the curious. That's some fabulously slow work.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It is worth remembering that the last recruitment surge has yielded a very high number of out of control agents. So maybe the inability of the administration to execute any plans, even their owns is a blessing? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ His father taught him well. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yeah but, they're like, the best.  The best agents. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ $13.6m to hire two agents? Sounds pretty suspect to me.

Mind you, I don’t think Border Guard or ICE are organisations most normal people would want to work for. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump clearly only hires the best  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Still better than the Benghazi strat, and a better love story than twilight. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Shut down ICE and all those FBI rejects will run to the border Patrol 
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Are they each making $6.8 million? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I think the congressional oversight committee could be going for the next two years and not scratch the surface of the blatant graft and fraud committed by this administration and its Republican senator cronies.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ They must have done work on the island hurricanes. Seems to similar. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Most corrupt administration that ever exsisted. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hey, I got a couple of t kids recruitment emails!!

I laughed, and laughed, and laughed...  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's like that company, whatever it was in North Dakota or Wyoming.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Remember when he hired an independent contractor to deliver meals to Puerto Rico and delivered 50,000 out of 30 million? 


https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-meals/fema-contractor-did-not-deliver-millions-of-puerto-rico-meals-lawmakers-idUSKBN1FQ2OP



This is all he’s doing, getting money to pay people who will never deliver on what they were paid to do




And I guarantee that they end donating to the Trump foundation ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It would be easy for them to hire all the people from the "Minutemen" group as Border Patrol agents.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I’m assuming it was two $6 million dollar men, plus spare parts? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ tbh I'm kind of ok with them being an abject failure in this endeavor, at least this way there are less assholes with guns wandering around. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I've been an operations manager for a while now. I've done my fair share of hiring. Should have gotten me to do it. I would have gotten at *least* 3 people for $14 million.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Oh shit, they are "sicarios". They are going to overturn a rival government/cartel. Lol ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Thanks Obama! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm so tired of all this winning! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The recruiter has been contacting me via LinkedIn since forever. Said company was “confidential”. No amount of money is enough.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The free market working as expected. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Anyone else remember the company they hired for the hurricane maria puerto rico cleanup? A $300m+ ... for a company of 4 people? 

Who then did.. nothing but out source to another company? A literal middle man. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'd like to be paid $6 million to patrol the border.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ More of our money down the drain. Between this, the continued housing of separated children, and the stunt w sending troops to border, it will soon be cheaper to just throw open the borders. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ In third world countries this is how government officials get a cut or percentage of the project cost, through kickbacks.

It works like this, the government officials will let your company win the bidding, the national government awards you the money, you then give the government officials their cut of the awarded money, you deliver the goods (sub-par due to costs of doing business with said government officials). Not necessarily in that order.

This is also done when building large infrastructure projects, like bridges, roads, buildings and huge walls. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Right, so they hired two, and then paid themselves the rest of the money.  Will ask for more later. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I mean, does anyone think Accenture ever does a good job?  This isn't the administrations mistake, the mistake is hiring a garbage company that anyone who has worked with them will tell you does a garbage job.

This might be the only thing I think Trump isn't at fault for, because Accenture might actually do a worse job running the country than he does. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ [deleted] ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's a $300M dollar contract for 7,500 people... So if they have spent a couple percent of the budget they have probably barely set up the project office. They are probably at the stage of needs assessment, well before the actual hiring deluge. This is faux-outrage to the max and a total clickbait misleading headline. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It is probably a payment to Accenture to develop something more in insidious than you can imagine. Since it is secret it is in the books as air quotes recruiting. ~end~

  ~cmt~ A wall is cheaper in the long run ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why doesn't the US government work with Mexico to build a wall on their border with Guatemala? It's only 200 miles long instead of 2000 miles. It would be 10 times less expensive and 1000 times more effective at preventing the kind of migration they say want to stop. Why is everyone in that administration so fucking stupid? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I wouldn't be surprised if this was a headline during any other presidency, swap "Trump" with any other one as well. Heck, our own government spent millions and millions of euros to get about 20 people from welfare to work. They should've just given them the money. Governments are often terrible at these things for some reason, and because a lot of it is public because it's tax payer money, you hear more stories.

Oh and all these consulting companies, whether management like Accenture, or Atos or whatever... they exist to suck you dry and leave your lifeless carcass on the ground. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well when you hire the very best people it costs a lot of money. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Sounds like when the Obama administration paid a private company what? a trillion? to create a website for the ACA. 

A website.  ~end~

  ~cmt~  Nepotism and other hiring irregularities would be the flip side to NOT hiring recruiters !!!

Chicago paid $$$Millions to lure applicants to the Police Dept.  
Mayor Rahm extended the deadline 3 times in 2016 and 2x in2018, because NOT enough blacks registered.  
Rahm does NOT get it.

Blacks do NOT want the job.

Many job applicants feel the same way about a CBP applicant.

BTW - just another HP bullshit story.  One sided biased reporting. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Why was Trump so mad? Schumer and Pelosi walked right into his trap. I mean, c'mon he did win Senate elections in North Dakota and Indiana right? Schumer and Trump both agree. So that means the Democrats have no.choice but to do whatever Trump wants right? He let them publicly embarrass him so they should let Mexico pay for the wall via increased economic growth in America? Really, that's how Mexico is paying for the wall? ~end~

Pelosi and Schumer didn't immediately fold and give him everything he wanted during this "negotiation," and cameras (that he wanted there) caught it all. So he stomps off and throws things like a cranky toddler.

And his little tantrum will be out of the news cycle in less than a day, as some new disaster (PR disaster, natural disaster, our regularly scheduled mass shooting) rears its head tomorrow. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ tRUmp needed to go to his safe space and watch Fox News  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That's impossible.  He's the most stable genius to ever hold the office.  His strategery saying he welcomes a shut down shows he has a full grasp of his responsibilities as head of the executive branch.

Stablest of geniuses. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It has been reported that Trump simply tears up anything he finds on his desk that he doesn't like - briefing notes, orders to sign, schedules. In fact, we know that the White House has a team of people whose job it is to put back together stuff has torn up, because it must be kept under federal records laws.

 It's not much of a stretch to believe Trump also throws briefing files around like an angry eight year old.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ this is honestly one of the dumbest genres of trump news. why do people click on these? "the president was mad"... are you still hoping he is nearing total anger meltdown and is going to magically explode taking pence with him? people being mad is not news. stop thinking this means something. ~end~

Why would the republican senate possibly remove Trump and Pence from office?

&#x200B;

It helps them in the next set of elections.  If they don't, they'll be crushed in 2020 in a way that they might not recover from.  If they do make Pelosi president, then they can rail against an unpopular democratic president, tag her with the upcoming recession and make the argument about how they have the best interests of the nation in mind and the evil democrats also managed a coup against the rightfully elected servants of god.

Personally, I'm convinced the flow of drugs will never stop, even if the wall is built. Also, I think the reason he can't argue 'sealing' the border against drugs   because his GOP predecessors totally fucked up 'the war on drugs'.  ~end~

  ~cmt~ Orrin Hatch, revealing the Republican Party Mantra.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >Twenty years ago, when it was Bill Clinton accused of obstruction of justice, Hatch demanded that Congress remove the sitting president from office, insisting that “committing crimes of moral turpitude such as perjury and obstruction of justice go to the heart of qualification for public office.” The Utahan added at the time, “This great nation can tolerate a president who makes mistakes, but it cannot tolerate one who makes a mistake and then breaks the law to cover it up. Any other citizen would be prosecuted for these crimes.”
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > Asked if he had any concerns that Trump was implicated, Hatch told CNN: “The Democrats will do anything to hurt this president.” Informed it was alleged by federal prosecutors in New York, Hatch said: “OK, but I don’t care, all I can say is he’s doing a good job as president.” […]

> “I don’t think he was involved in crimes but even then, you know, you can make anything a crime under the current laws if you want to, you can blow it way out of proportion, you can do a lot of things.”

Holy shit. Hatch is literally saying **he doesn't care if Trump committed a crime**. This isn't some sideways interpretation of his words--he legitimately is saying he doesn't care.

If "you can make anything a crime under the current laws if you want to", *then what is the point of having laws*?

Jesus Christ, the whole Republican party is complicit in protecting a criminal. ~end~

Blatant hypocrisy and cynicism aside, I'm perfectly fine judging Trump on the health of economy after the inevitable [crash](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/a56y7o/yellen_warns_of_another_potential_financial/) comes. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ For years Fox news, Rush Limbaugh and other news outlets have been pushing the false narrative that the Democrats have been engaged in crimes like murder (Bengazi, Seth Rich) , child trafficking (Pizzagate) , and other myriad of crimes.  And they have said or inferred that the Democrats don't care or are covering up the crimes.  In reality,  there were no crimes. Everything was thoroughly debunked or investigated.  But the right wing folks keep acting like the Democrats have gotten away with this same crap for years. 

So it is no surprise although it is disappointing,  that now  actual crimes are being uncovered,  the people who pushed the crap against Democrats are shrugging and saying "who cares". They figured your team got away with all the crap,  why shouldn't ours.  They don't care that their version of events aren't based in reality
 ~end~

**Attention Republicans - If you are not on board with Democrats giving food stamps to everyone, opening the borders, immigration reform, healthcare for all, being able to say merry christmas and all the scary things that keep you up at night cleaning your remmingtons. The word is precedent. Once your Congress and House allows the president to go unchecked and lawlessness to be the norm the same will be allowed on the other side, Imagine President Pelosi and her peers pushing through the legislation you hate. Imagine them coming for your guns. Why? Because in 2018 we decided it was kay for our political leaders to be criminals. That disease is not gonna stay party specific and history shows us that both parties will get to rule and you are so fucked when the Democrats take over because you let lawlessness prevail, you did not just tread on democracy you were pouring the water and cheering as it eroded. Your future and mine is fucked because of your willingness to put your party over the law.** ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ How about reporters just start asking 'do you support criminals?' 'do you think people who break the law belong in jail?' these politicians are pro-white collar crime and reporters should focus on that a bit.  ~end~

Thank you to those who voted blue in the midterms.  Your vote will pay off on January 3. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It’s kind of funny that of all the hate and delusions that the various peons of the GOP has spewed, it was *Melania* who had the clearest messaging. 

“I Really Don’t Care, Do U?” was the perfect campaign slogan for the policies and actions that the GOP have embraced. It’s too bad that people keep voting for them then are shocked when the GOP actually proves they don’t care after all. ~end~

  ~cmt~ These jerks are never going to admit they are wrong.

Trump is the best thing to happen to this country simply because through him, ALL of these authoritarian wannabes are being EXPOSED every single day. They are absolutely corrupt and there is no denying it.

Any other republican President would have had the sense to at least put on a facade. Not Trump. He is loud and undisciplined, and through him the Republican Party is feeling untouchable. They DO NOT believe the law applies to them, as this senator just demonstrated.

They don’t give a crap about the constitution except when it works to give them more power. They don’t give a crap about laws. And they don’t give a crap about democracy. Nobody is voting for them so they’ve lied and cheated their way to power for years, and nobody batted an eye. The rise of Trump put an end to that bulls*t because people started to pay attention!

We are seeing across the country that the Republican Party is the REAL friggin enemy of the people. I’m SO 
Thankful for Trump because of this.

The question then becomes, why are we not clubbing them with the same stick they’ve used against us for 20 years? Is it because we are not comfortable so blatantly assuming the moral high ground? Rather I think we simply don’t have the power yet, but we will soon. All at once the GOP will abandon their candidate when everything is laid bare, but for now they’re clinging to their vestiges of power for as long as they can hold out.

Their crimes against American democracy are unforgivable. When Democrats finally emerge from the political wilderness, they must take a new form. One that holds our democratic institutions to a higher standard than our current leadership, which shouldn’t be a high bar to clear, but we must reject any shape, any philosophy that doesn’t attempt to do just that.

  ~cmt~ This is why him being removed from office is never going to happen. No matter how clear the evidence against him is. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Before even clicking the link I thought, "I bet its Orrin Hatch." 

The most shameless partisan in Washington. Trump could shoot his wife and he would find a way around voting for impeachment.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Remember trump gave Hatch a medal of freedom.  Hatch worships him now. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Despicable old crooks. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ *"The facts tell nothing to him. Even if I shower him with information, with authentic proof, with documents, with pictures; even if I take him by force to the Soviet Union and show him [a] concentration camp, he will refuse to believe it, until he [receives] a kick in his fan-bottom. When a military boot crashes his balls then he will understand. But not before that. That's the [tragedy] of the situation of demoralization.”* ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And therein lies the issues. Republicans only care about this shit when it involves a democrat. Whenever involves one of their, they detach from all opinion and responsibility. They're weak individuals and they know it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > “I don’t think he was involved in crimes but even then, you know, you can make anything a crime under the current laws if you want to, you can blow it way out of proportion, you can do a lot of things.” 


So now the laws regarding pretty much whatever they are going to charge Trump with, whatever they are, are some because 'you can make anything a crime'. 



These people are degenerates. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Self-proclaimed party of law and order, ladies and gentlemen. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Republicans disgust me with their hypocrisy. They are vile. Moral rot.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Fuck you Orrin, you dead eyed bitch ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Orrin Hatch is why we need age limits for government positions.

Nobody should be able to spend a lifetime inflicting harmful legislation and political discourse onto the rest of America knowing damned well that they will be in the ground long before the negative effects manifest.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >you can make anything a crime under the current laws if you want to, you can blow it way out of proportion, you can do a lot of things

Then why isn't Hillary in jail ?  :) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It blows my mind that literally millions of people (who are not the 1%) still vote for this party.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Add Hatch to the list of worthless scumbags who are traitors to our country.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Surprisingly or not surprisingly Hatch had previously said "This great nation can tolerate a President who makes mistakes. But it cannot tolerate one who makes a mistake and then breaks the law to cover it up.” But that was when speaking about a Democrat. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why don't these GOP motherfuckers just say it: "Trump makes me money and that's all that matters"? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It is incredible how quickly this president has eroded the rule of law  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is easy to fix. The House just shuts down the government. No laws for ANYTHING. Period. 

The GOP threatened shutdown like 7 of 8 Obama years over petty pretend crap. The GOP always says the Federal Government is useless.. let’s PROVE that, right now!!!  First demand is that Mcconell is removed, not just from Speaker but from the Senate. Second demand is that Trump is removed... non-negotiable, absolutely no other laws on the table til that happens. 

The GOP needs to be housebroken, now. We can get this done in two years if the Dems are willing to be vicious. We need to eliminate this notion that “taxes are evil” and “the government doesn’t do any good” once and for all.. is been a poison on politics for almost 40 years.. it’s going to hurt, but they’ve already made sure a big recession is coming and sabotaged every economic safety net put in place since 2009.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ There's no reasoning with the Republican Party. Keep pressuring them, vote them the crap out in force, and pray Muller doesn't exonerate Trump. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ A politician being a self serving paritsan and a hyprocrit. Also in the news, water is wet. 

Let's see the quotes AFTER Mueller's report is given and SDNY has filed. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > Who cares about law and order? We don't. Not unless we can use it against our political enemies."

  ~cmt~ Every single Republican in Congress belongs in prison.  This crap is ridiculous.  They are actual enemies of the country. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ When are we going to start talking about all the last bit of humane regulations that Paul Ryan silently dismantled over the last two years? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hatch: "I don't care"

The reasonable people of Utah: "Get fucked" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Let that be your epitaph you little shit ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Republican motto:

> WE DON'T REALLY CARE. ~~DO YOU?~~ AND WE DON'T CARE IF YOU DO EITHER. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It’s because of these senile old fools that the U.S. is in this position in the first place. Like Trump, they give zero fucks about anyone but themselves - as long as they have a comfy seat in Congress, there’s a Republican President in the White House, and are making lots on money then everything about their pathetic little world is just fine to them. 

They seem to have zero ability to look at any situation objectively - like what we are seeing with Trump and the Mueller charges against Cohen - and say “this is wrong” ... unless of course it’s a Democrat who’s doing it. 

And like others have said, they *all* need to be voted out of office in the coming years.  Even those who are “now considering breaking step with Trump and pushing back” - it’s _way_ too late for that, you motherfuckers ... you would have earned people’s respect if you’d done it two years ago. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I will dance on Hatch's grave.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Orrin Hatch, Making his Grand Entry in History. 
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ We need to hold this president, every single participant of this administration, and each one of the feckless members of the Republican Party accountable, despite Senators like Orrin Hatch refusing to do so. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Drag these MFs out in the street. It's beyond time for the next revolution. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I would bet Orrin Hatch's constituents care. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He and all his cronies DO care.  They're terrified that there will turn out to be a political cost for all their amoral, self-dealing horseshit.  That's why they're trying to play this down.  And that's why we have to do everything we can to make sure it doesn't quietly go away the way they hope it will. ~end~

  ~cmt~ “You can make anything a crime under the current laws if you want to, you can blow it way out of proportion, you can do a lot of things.” says decades-long lawmaker and leader of his political party, prior chairman of Senate Judiciary Committee. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I wonder how many of them would change their tone if they found out that they were being investigated for conspiring with the president since they allow him to do whatever he wants. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The Republican Party and it’s politicians are so corrupt that of course it makes sense that Orrin doesn’t care. All they care about is finding a means to an end. Virtue is not morality, virtue is strength by whatever means. Politics in Utah and the US at large only care about Virtue as defined by Machiavelli. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is where all of this is leading. At the end of this long winding road it will just be us as a people looking at each other. One side will say this is not how things should be done in America, and the other will say yes it is. Neither side will be able to budge. 

The question will be what happens then? Do the American people have the capacity to go to war with one another again? I don't see this ending well. When Trump said he could shoot someone on 5th Avenue and his supporters would still love him he was being prophetic. In the end he will have supporters that love him not just *in spite* of his crimes but *because* of his crimes. 

  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I mean what did you expect? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is just hard and embarrassing to watch 😩 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He would have never said that 20 years ago but he has always been a scum bag and now emboldened by Trump, he is showing his true colors.  As long as Trump is around, we are going to have a lot of suspicions confirmed or denied. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Anyone surprised? This is  Orrin Hatch lol ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ They forget that they after civil servants. No one gives a shit how much you care asshole, the point is your people care and you need to act.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ God I hope Romney will be a better Senator. I doubt it cause every single GOP Senator has been trash but I’m hoping he at least have an ounce of integrity. We need that right now ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So many republicans are saying the quiet part loud now.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What a sackless sack of shit ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Of course he doesn't care. Trump gave him a Medal of Freedom ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That's what happens when you have no convictions or beliefs. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Thankfully he's retiring but too bad it's not today ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That’s been his response about anything or anyone Republican. He didn’t really care months ago about Brett Kavanaugh’s past either.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is the party everyone is pushing for bipartisanship with.  They are not good faith actors.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What a breathtaking level of amorality: "The retiring Utah Republican added that 'we ought to judge' Trump on the health of the economy, not on his suspected crimes." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Senator?  Call him by his fucking name, Orrin Hatch.  Assholes.

>Utah Senator Orrin Hatch says, "I don't care." when asked about allegations against Trump. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The GOP knows they're fucked. They're the party of uneducated rural voters and scared old people. So they have to take whatever they can get. Right now, Trump is what they have, Trump is who they're stuck with, and they will use him to push whatever conservative fuck-you policies they can, while they can. 

2020 isn't looking great for them in the Senate, and 2016 was an extremely lucky break for them. 

No matter what the Dems do in the House, no matter what Mueller investigates, there will be no impeachment, guys. Flake and Rubio might be "worried" or whatever, but that's it. 

2020 Presidential election is how Trump will be (or won't be) removed from power - there is no magical Jesus coming to save us through the courts.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ When asked about the livelihood of Senator Warren Hatch, most Americans say, "I don't care."  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump is doing great things for old rich white conservative religious men like Orin. You’ve got to give him that! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well you heard it here folks. If the GOP don’t have to care then any accusation lodged against the Dems should be met with equal “meh”. GOP has set the precedent on what can be ignored ~end~

  ~cmt~ Why is anyone surprised by this? He’s saying this because that’s what the voters have told them.  ~end~

Ok, there are like 10 people in Trump admin that... "don't care!" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ OMG - Motherfucker.

In a fantasy world I'd stop paying his pension and cancel his gold-plated healthcare plan - and reply to any of his inquiries with "I don't care...but take solace in the thought that the President is doing a good job". ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is one of those things that didn't even need to be reported, though. Anyone who knows anything about this ass already knows this and anyone who would vote for a person like him doesn't care. Republicans play by a very odd set of rules. They have long since given up on facts or hard truths. They're interested in power by any means necessary. This asshole's always been that way.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ “I don’t think he was involved in crimes but even then, you know, you can make anything a crime under the current laws if you want to, you can blow it way out of proportion, you can do a lot of things.”






Really? The lengths to which people like hatch are willing to expose themselves to protect Donald somehow still amazes me ~end~

  ~cmt~ Can it be a felony to not care about the integrity of the laws if you are a law maker?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He’s leaving office at the start of the new year, right?  Replaced by ole Mittens.  So yeah, Hatch doesn’t care, he’s on his way out. His part of the grift is over, he doesn’t have to pretend to care anymore. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hatch: "... all I can say is he's doing a good job as president."

"...we ought to judge (him) by the health of the economy, not the suspected crimes."

Actually, I think he, and Hatch, fail at "the economy" also, as much or more than the other issues. Their simple short term advantages are going to turn into long term pain for the average populous. Hatch must know this, must not care. 
He's just happy with IQ45 as he is enabling them to seat pre-approved partisan 'conservative' fanatic judges at will. ...play their party gamey moves. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Which also means Utah doesn’t care, they are responsible for putting this guy into office for decades.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This headline needs corrected.  REPUBLICAN senator says, 'I don't care' ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hatch is also retiring in less than a month. I don't think he cares about anything right now. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Uh yeah I thought that was a given. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What do we expect them to do - automatically impeach the GOP President because there's a line in an SDNY report not backed up with any evidence? Of course they're not going to comment before the actual evidence against the POTUS is presented. Dems would do the same.

The 'Cohen is a liar how can anyone believe anything he says' line is pretty fucking ironic, especially after the President himself has already undeniably lied to the media about these payments on multiple occasions. But it's also why I really really really hope there's audio tape or some other hard evidence to prove Trump directed those payments. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Might as well give him Melania's green jacket.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is worth mentioning: He's head of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  What's that? His role is to oversee the Department of Justice (DOJ), consider executive nominations, and review pending legislation.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "It apparently didn’t occur to Hatch to ask Americans to judge the Democratic president on the health of the economy in 1998."
.Boom. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Then he shouldn't care about Hillary's emails. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Kinda sums up the GOP of today. 
Those guys are pathetic.  ~end~

President Donald Trump is escalating his shutdown threat over U.S.-Mexico border wall funding at a heated White House meeting with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.

Trump said during the open-press session Tuesday that, “If we don’t have border security, we’ll shut down the government.” He says his long-promised wall will be built one way or another.

Government funding for some agencies is set to expire on Dec. 21, threatening a partial shutdown.

Schumer and Pelosi are urging the president to find another solution, with Schumer saying “we shouldn’t shut down the government over a dispute.”

Trump is responding by saying he’s “proud to shut down the government” and says he will “take the mantle.”

Pelosi is also commenting on the meeting’s acrimony, noting “this has spiraled downwards.”"

  ~cmt~ Everytime someone says it is cause of Democrats I want to see a video of Trump saying Mexico will pay for it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Remember when Trump insisted, again and again, that Mexico would pay for his wall and that America wouldn't have to pay for it at all?

Yeah.

Funny how that hasn't happened, huh? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~  White House reporters coming out of the meeting between President Trump, Senator Chuck Schumer and Rep Nancy Pelosi look stunned. I'm told all three were yelling at each other, sparring openly and accusing each other of mischaracterizing comments.  ~end~

  ~cmt~ The CSPAN video is painful to watch. You never realize how delusional and sub-par intellectually Trump is until he speaks for more than 30 seconds. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump admits he’s proud to shut down the government if he doesn’t get the wall. And his base will still think he’s awesome. What a mess.  ~end~

While I was wary about Nancy Pelosi becoming speaker(I was worried about all the bipartisanship talks) she bitch slapped Trump in front of the media and it was amazing. I would still like her to take someone under her wing in case she does become president over the next two years, I think we’ll be fine with her as speaker.

Schumer’s shit eating grin was even better. “When he brings in South Dakota and Indiana, he knows he’s in trouble.”

Her voice is like nails on a chalkboard. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Holy shit, the exchange is amazing. Watch it in full. Trump explicitly says he will take responsibility for the shutdown. Right before Christmas too. A press spray is supposed to be a photo-op and some pleasantries, not  arguing domestic policy while reporters stand there in stunned silence. Trump even trotted out some bullshit note-card propaganda and tried to corner Chuck and Nancy, but Nancy was like “Those figures aren’t even accurate” and then Trump looked like a stupid whiny bitch. 

THEN after the press is asked to leave he’s like “Oh yeah and by the way, I have plenty of picks for a chief of staff, ok?”. I watched with my jaw open the whole time. 

Another side note, does Trump only know like 10 people? The people that are being floated are Steve Mnuchin, Matt Whitaker, Chris Christie and a few others.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If you don't have the votes you don't have the votes, that's democracy and that's the representatives democracy has given us. You can't just shut down the fucking government because you want to be a dictator.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ lol Trump is a grifter through and through.  It's clear he has no idea what the fuck he's talking about, especially as it relates to Pelosi's knowledge of how gov't works.  Trump's entire political being right now boils down to a fucking wall.  His admin is entirely now based on fear of the "other".   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Thought I was paywalled... Nope just turns out the headline is the entire article.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Republicans love government shutdowns. They’ve caused the government to shut down at least 3 times in recent memory.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ remember when trump bragged that he was the best negotiator? not today donny, not today ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Who the hell was screaming "PRESS LET'S GO MAKE YOUR WAY OUT"???? I mean who does that? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Mexico has now the power to shut down US government. Trump made Mexico great again. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ «You betcha! If I don’t get my way legally I’ll do it anyway!» thank you Chuck and Nancy for that sweet trap.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pelosi:  Thousands of people will lose their jobs

Trump:  We have record low unemployment.

Yeah, but not if you shut down the government you idiot. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He's just such a bad listener. He doesn't look at the person who's speaking; he's clearly just waiting until it's his turn to talk. He constantly interrupts and belittles.

Even if you like his politics, I just can't understand how you look at that behavior and think "leader". ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "If you noticed it's getting a lot less crowded in Mexico." Dude WHAT?! And comparing the wall to Israel's?!?

Dude you said "wall" like 80, 90 mutherfucking times. It's too many times.

So many words, so little sense... get the poor guy out of there, he's clearly realized he made a horrible mistake by running for President and tripping into the White House, and is too chickenshit to fire himself. Help the poor fella, give him a juice box, a teddy bear, and escort him out of there. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Anyone else watch and realize how strange it is when Trump looks for approval and validation from Chuck multiple times after a playful remark?  Things like this remind me of the Howard Stern quote where he claimed Trump just wants to be loved, and it just seems painfully true over and over again--even amongst all the vial hatred Trump spews. IMO it adds complexity to the situation, but is a trait you can't look over in describing Don to future generations--to many people he is charismatic... Oh well though here we are and it's almost 2019, thoughts and prayers these next few months Donnie, can't wait for your family's indictments. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The way trump says wall... like, he really is a child. I have no idea how any politician can sit there with him and listen to him over prolonged periods. Remember folks, trump stated he will NOT blame you (Schumer, democrats, etc.) for the government shutdown. He will bear the mantle, it will be on him. I was watching the clip and you can see Schumer smiling because he realized trump walked right into it. In front of the press and nation, stating he would be proud to have a shut down and it will be on him. Congrats GOP, this is who you have all fallen in line with.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ We really need more of these events. Having people actually confront him on his bs before the cameras is needed. You can tell he does not know how to react and when pushed it pushes back hard without thinking. That is why he already just made a massive mistake. They played him like the fool. Now they have it on record they will focus on funding government, not the wall. He on the other hand, declared he gets what he wants or shut down. That means democrats can easily not pay for it and either keeps his word or backtracks and looks to have caved. It is a lose/lose situation since if he caves, he looks weak. If he shuts it down, he stated it is on him, not the democrats. He got completely outplayed in front of all the cameras.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This reminds me so much of a king demanding a moat for his castle and his council trying to convince him that it's expensive AND won't make a difference. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~  Pelosi and Schumer played him like a fiddle.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ my favorite part was Schumer's laugh when Trump said he wants to argue publicly because he wants transparency. so much irony ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I take back half the bad things I said about Pelosi. She made Trump look the mouth breathing village idiot he is  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He’s had the majority in the house & senate for 2 years & couldn’t get it passed. He needs to get over it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ [Video link](https://youtu.be/RZ82YmOM804) of the meeting ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Can he say "wall" more?  I'm not sure I knew he was obsessed with a wall.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The whole time I was watching Pence to see if he would nod in agreement to what Trump was saying or whatever, and he never did. He just sat there.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm just going to throw this out there, because it's such a crazy thought:

THE POSSIBILITY OF A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN SHOULD NOT BE ROUTINE. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Nancy just said to Trumps face that he is lying, holy shit, and he agreed . Crazy ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is so, so embarrassing. 

To see this absolute donut sitting in the Oval Office while all these legitimate politicians have to sit around and take his tempter tantrums seriously.... it's surreal. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What even is the point of Mike Pence. He does or says nothing. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why does the wall need to even be in the budget when Mexico is going to pay for it? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ but I thought Mexico was paying for it? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Government doesn’t work, elect me and I’ll prove it. 

— GOP ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He kept claiming that “tremendous” amounts of the wall have been built... does he live in the same universe as the rest of us? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Remember that time Trump threatened several states’ federal funding over the travel ban?   This is a rerun.    Art of the Deal, mmmmk. 

The wall is getting built, just like all of those factories are coming back.   Magical thinking.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Something became abundantly clear from watching that. You could with good probability assume everything Trump says is a lie. I heard that they have little wall built, the renovations are shit, it was over budget and ineffective.  0 terrorists were caught last month.  He doesn't have the votes in the house and he doesn't want the government to shut down and if it does he'll blame chuck and Nancy. And no one wants to be chief of staff and they need to hurry because this guy sucks. We're not being friendly.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ [A government shutdown will be devastating to our military...something the Dems care very little about!](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/953987636057821184) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I just watched the MSNBC video. Holy shit! Quick question:

&#x200B;

Where are these ten terrorists you were bragging about?! We caught TEN TERRORISTS and the news hasn't covered this at all! How incredible... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Schumer and Pelosi should have hit him harder on the consequences of a shutdown and his need for funding for the wall.

Oh, so you’re proud to shutdown the government? Will you still be proud when the elderly aren’t getting their social security checks? Will you still be proud when hardworking government employees aren’t getting paid? Will you still be proud when people don’t get their federal tax return checks? And by the way, wasn’t Mexico supposed to pay for this wall? Wasn’t that your promise to the American people when you were campaigning? And now you’re threatening to shut down the government so you can break a campaign promise?

They had such an opportunity to hammer this dude, and they failed to utilize it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why hasn't Donnie - the bestest deal maker in the history of deal making - gotten Mexico to pay for his wall like he said we would? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ https://www.c-span.org/video/?455813-1/president-trump-democratic-leaders-clash-border-funding ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This dude is a giant baby, a traitor, and a disgusting representation of the people of this country. Throwing a fit because he cant get funding for his little wall when he told all his supporters Mexico would pay for it. Why anyone would support him and think hes doing a good job is beyond me. It's just lies and stupidity frothing out his mouth between half chewed chunks of big macs. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >iT toTalLY SoLveS THe PrObLEMZ

Oh my god. How can you listen to this guy and hear nothing but mindless, repetitive rambling. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well that was one of the most surreal things I've ever witnessed. I loved Pence when the camera was on Pelosi and Trump going at it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ With his bloviating and those enormous eye bags, he looks like a fat and useless creature my five year-old designed in Spore. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pelosi owned Trump like the little bitch he is.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump's "threats" should be taken as seriously as a tiny dog barking at a squirrel. There has rarely been a weaker, more clownishly ineffectual human being, let alone President.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ When the President brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he's in real trouble". Holy shit Chuck Schumer is savage. That was hilarious. And of course Mike Pence didn't say a single word the entire time. He's just biding his time until Trump gets impeached so he can be President.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The dumb pig gets completely rolled by Schumer & Pelosi every time they have a meeting lmao. Have fun with the new blue House majority, buddy. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pence: *If I don't breath maybe they won't prosecute me.* ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ There's plenty of fair criticism regarding Schumer, but speaking as a constituent I can tell you this: he *loves* the camera. He knows what plays well and how to make himself look good and whoever he's up against look bad. That's certainly clear here. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ His stats are straight out of Stalin's playbook.  If you're going to make up numbers, at least make them plausible.   

Also, percent reductions  mean nothing without knowing the base rate.  But I guess anyone in the Trump camp is too stupid to get that. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Jesus christ what did I just watch. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Who are these ten terrorists? When and how were they caught? Is the President revealing classified information again? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "last time the government was shutdown it didn't work"/ "I will shutdown the government". Nice logic there lil donnie boy ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump at the he end of the day is a used car salesman. He doesn't really care or know much about what he's selling, or how it will affect the customer. He doesn't care if it's a lemon or a bargain. All he cares about is a 'sale'. At this stage of his presidency he doesn't have any meaningful or worthwhile accomplishments and the recent election exposed as much. Right now he's looking to make a sale, and he needs a sale bad...and here he is trying to sell a lemon wall. Lying to get it sold, telling everyone "if you walk off the lot, I won't give you this offer again".  The oval office 'debate' was so transparent, comical, and sad at the same time. 

Idiots idea of what a CEO is supposed to be like.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If you watch to the end, Huckabee Sanders starts yelling "PRESS! OUT OF THE ROOM, NOW!"

Lol, she finally got another moment ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ How many times did he say the words "border security"?  50? 60? ~end~

  ~cmt~ If the goal is to destroy America, Trump is doing very well.  Putin must be pleased. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >	To be sure, these are not the only factors behind the stock-market sell-off. Rising deficits have spooked bond markets; enthusiasm about the large corporate tax cuts passed in December 2017 has faded; the strong dollar is often cited as a headwind for corporate earnings; U.S. stock valuations remain rich; China’s economy has slowed; Brexit is problematic, and the rest of Europe has more than a few messy problems. Any combination of these could be contributing to market volatility.

>	That said, we are nearing the halfway mark of Trump’s presidency. ***Those waiting for that pivot toward his being presidential have been disappointed.*** Instead, they are now extrapolating his policy errors forward, and finding a significant and negative affect on the U.S. economy and stock markets.

“Disappointed” — understatement of the year.

  ~cmt~ When you let the dog who barks and chases the car actually drive it, and when he inevitably tears through the neighborhood wrecking everything, can you sue the dog that has no insurance?

The worst thing wasn't that we have a criminal president but that we allowed a criminal to become president. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's almost like the guy with numerous chapter 11 bankruptcies, that couldn't keep a fucking casino operational, is a really bad businessman.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Our economy is so strong we could have weathered any one of these idiot moves. All three is too much. And the “benefit” to mega corporations granted by the tax cuts are wiped out by tariffs. So even they hate this.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It was extremely smart to do all three....if you are trying to destroy the western alliance in general and the US in particular. Who do we know that would want to do that and is \*cough\* influential with Trump? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Conservatives are trying to say the market is reacting to the incoming Dem house lol.  They havent even got there yet and its already their fault.  Beyond frustrating  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The fed chair seems like revisionist history to mean. During Powells appointment hearings, most analysts were calling him Yellen 2.0. They saw no difference in policy between them and the move was basically so Trump could claim the fed appointment as his own.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It also wasn’t smart to stimulate the economy with tax cuts during an expansion, but you’ll never hear Bloomberg speak that heresy.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's almost like looking into his financial history when running on the reputation of being a great businessman should have mattered more......because his entire fucking adult life is filled with these kinds of self-destructive decisions. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm not gonna blame him for what the fed is doing. He's only tangentially related to that. I Blame him for adding so much volatility to the market. You can't lie about a fucking trade deal.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why does nobody consider that [this is the plan](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-2007-i-m-excited-housing-market-crash-n578761).  Trump has often voiced that he likes bad markets because it is cheaper for him to buy what he wants, and crashing our economy is not accidental but by design. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I disagree only on the Fed Chair part. The Fed can't just hold interest rates near zero forever. When the economy is heated up is the *exact* time you pull back on the credit supply and let productivity rather than credit infusion guide the economy. Jerome Powell is doing *exactly* the right thing in trying to pull the reins a bit while the Trump white house pursues GDP growth no matter the cost. Powell thinks the Fed should usually seek to set the rate according to a fixed equation (I forget the name of it), which I think would be great for the markets. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He has failed in business over and over. He made his fortune by laundering money for the Russian mob. 

So, not only does he NOT know what he is doing, but he is a criminal. I would even go as far as say that Russia planted him in this seat of power to purposely screw things up for the USA. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Most incompetent president in history, supported by the most idiotic clown supporters in history.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "or" instead of "and" in the article's title would have been better. but yeah, Trump isn't smart ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump is just a symptom.  A half-vast recession, leading to a decent recovery.   But things are a lot oworse, because the  Far Right Dark Money Pools own this stock market.

Our leaders have not yet grasped that they are dealing with Russian money ...mixed with Dark Right Money pools like the Koch brothers' syndicate, ...which includes cash loaned against untaxed money held outside the country ...traced via the Panama Papers, ..and spent on fake news empires controlled by Rupert Murdoch and others, ...and that all of this is part of a deliberate long term plan to tear down the United States government as the financial backers understand it.  We are headed toward recognizing a fatal flaw =>There are libertarians who believe that their money means they are above the law of any puny geographic jurisdiction.  As if money was not issued by puny jurisdictions.  <= 

This is not ALL old white men, it is not ALL rich people, it is not ALL of our elites.  It is a definable number of ***identifiable people*** trying to tear down our country and Western Europe.  These political donors cannot deny they have knowingly put their cash into Dog Whistle Politics and worse.

Many of them own ***identifiable companies*** with with listed stocks.  How is their stock price going to look when the truth comes out ?  This is not just one or two small cap stocks, you know.

  ~cmt~ The anti-Trump trade was doing the rounds last year, to trade the opposite of any sentiment he tweeted about a firm. He inherited a smooth market and knocked it off its rails through pure incompetence. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Drive up costs for businesses and consumers, create a sugar high in corporate equities by encouraging a wave of stock buybacks, destabilize emerging markets and China while they restructure their economies, and invite retaliation against key agricultural and industrial interests.  It won't end well, even if it is not readily apparent in some areas today (consumer and gov't spending remain high, even though CAPEX is slowing).  And yes, Trump will own it because he's staked his political legacy on the performance of the market.  He will try to blame Congress, the Fed and China for market issues.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I heard someone (don't remember where) blamed the Dems election wins as to why the market is falling. 🙄 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ People who say they’re a genius, but really aren’t smart, often do stupid things. Not surprised.

  ~cmt~ All he has done is participate in MASSIVE amounts of corporate welfare. Every chance he gets to take more money away from tax payers and give it to private corporations, most of which who pay little to no taxes at all, and then the GOP loves to proclaim we have the strongest economy ever but for who? 5 people? Most of the people that vote GOP got screwed by the very tax plan they cheer on.. How do you combat that level of ignorance to even begin fixing the mess we are in? When 30% of your country, which amounts to about a 100 million people mind you, argues in favor of making things worse, how do fix that? Having shitty politicians is bad, having 1/3 of you populace back them no matter what is downright fucking horrifying. ~end~

  ~cmt~ But..but..but trade wars is easy to win.  Trump said so. ~end~

  ~cmt~ He bragged about the stock market every day in 2017 on Twitter. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Party of fiscal responsibility, my ass. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What really pisses me off about Trump, is that he actually could have been one of our greatest presidents, instead, he's going to be the worst. 

He had the power to make deals left and right with congress. If on day one, he had invited democrat leaders to the White House, asked them what big legislation they wanted pushed through, and agreed to support it, he could have pushed through his own agenda, and probably kept a lot of heat off of himself.

Hire actual professionals to fill cabinants, even a couple of democrats, and he would win over most of the country, and not really have to do anything at all.  

It's a shame. ~end~

  ~cmt~ If Diamond Joe Biden were a real person, he'd make a vastly.better President than what we got. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump discovered that he had to try to cash the checks he wrote to his supporters on the campaign trail if he wanted a shot at 2020. The problem is he didn't know how to actually accomplish any of that so went off of peripheral buzzwords that sound like they do something (trade -> tariffs) to try and get some sort of chaos to occur around those promises.

Just more observations that point towards the idea that he never expected to get as far as actually winning. He didn't think he'd have to do the things he said he would do. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And everyone except him will pay for it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Manchurian President. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I can’t look at my portfolio:( ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The rise in interest rates will keep some of the P/E ratios in check as well as give the Fed some ammo to loosen the economy in the event of a recession.  The deficit can be contained by getting a rope around entitlements, but good luck on that (queue the commercial of Granny being pushed off the cliff).  Trump is smart to begin reigning in China with their huge tariffs on US goods and bullshit theft of US intellectual property; somebody had to take them on but Obama, Bush, and Clinton didn’t have the stones to. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Oh come on guys. You know its only Trump's fault when its good. When its bad it was like... who's the current republican scapegoat? Ocasio-Cortez? Yeah, it's Ocasio-Cortez's fault. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ i hate donald trump, any one like me. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > It wasn’t smart to dump a dovish Fed chief, run up the deficit, and start a trade war. Trump did all three.

well, besides himself, who has ever called him a smart person?

&#x200B; ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And yet again, like in the rest of his pathetic life, he won't be responsible for cleaning his own shit up afterwards... I think It's time for IRS to come in knocking and take everything that he or anyone in the Trump family owns and give it back and If he gets impeached for being illegitimate, he should return every single penny he spent fucking Hitleresqueing around the country parading his shit and his fruitless trips i.e. Singapore trip for NK meeting ~end~

  ~cmt~ I despise Trump, but don't get so giddy that the last month or two has been volatile for the stock market. It's still up 25% from where it was when he was elected. Going nuts on this issue of all things gets shot down pretty quick when him or one of his grubs mentions that it went up 25% for Obama over 8 years, and 25% for Trump in 2 and a half.

You can complain as much as you want about Trump's immigration policies, but when it comes to economics, the only valid criticism is towards his budget deficit (different from trade deficit). ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Does he own this bull market or is it because of Obama?  Can you please make up your mind as to which narrative will be pushed? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I gave him 0% credit when stock market was up earlier this year, so I’m not ready to give him 100% credit for its recent failings. It seems impossible to deny that his policy has had a direct impact in the recent downturn. But there are so many factors impacting it that Trump is only a small part of it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Obama was claiming credit for the stock market just last month.  Now it’s Trump fault again?  So hard to keep track.

This is fairly straightforward- when something good happens, it’s really to Obama’s credit, but if something bad happens, it’s all Trumps fault.

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Market goes up: Thanks Obama!

Marketgoes down: Damn you Trump!

&#x200B;

The attitude is really as dumb as Trump taking credit everytime it rises. Plus the Dow is up over last 2 years, and roughly the same as last year ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Under Obama the Fed [printed money like mad](https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart) between zero percent interest rates and Quantitative Easing.

That went on for eight years, and did a lot more to ding the long term health of the country than anything Trump did in a year and half. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ [removed] ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The biggest influence on the markets is the interest rates, which Trump has no control over. Turn on 0% interest rates and also instate some QE and lets see what happens to the stock market. However, that wouldn't be healthy for the economy, and its also foolish to use the stock market as the sole evidence of how an economy is functioning.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ [deleted] ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This says just as much about the fickleness of the stock market than it does about anything else. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And guess what they were the smartest moves. China just conceded so I guess our farmers will be ok. He ran up a budget deficit but did not add to our national debt like Obama to the tune of 9 trillion.  Maybe stop looking at opinion pieces and headlines and try doing some research...  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump starts trade war- Market all time high. Liberals bitch it wont last, and say he has to stop it.  Tech companies projected to falter due to tarrifs. 

Trump Stops trade war, Market has worst week in 2018, Liberals claim it has nothing to do with ending the trade war.  Tech earnings for 2018 wiped out in less than a week. 

Im not sure what to believe anymore.

  ~cmt~ I can honestly say that I don't, at this moment, recall what Pence's voice even sounds like. He's always the silent guy in the back looking uncomfortable.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pence on the fence? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pence looks like someone who's lawyers told him to shut the fuck up months ago. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pence look like he took an edible about 20 minutes before that meeting started and then it started to hit him halfway through the presser. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ These guys are toast.

They know their days are numbered. All of their shady dealings are going to come into the light and they know it.

It is going to happen. 

Pence looks like he has been scared straight. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Pence on the fence" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ no wonder why sessions left.. there can be only one elf in the white house and pence was mad it was not him ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pence strikes me as the kind of guy who likes to sit back and watch as someone is getting boned in the room. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Contest:  Who can come up with the greatest response to "What happy thought does Mike Pence retreat to when Trump starts going off the rails." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He was just sitting there thinking "Don't have sexy thoughts. Don't have sexy thoughts...." then he had a sexy thought  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pence looks like a bobblehead, when the head is glued down. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He was probably stoned af.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ From reading the various stories coming out of the meeting, I wasn't even aware Pence was there. Heck... I even saw pictures and video and didn't notice him. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He’s like a servile Christian wife. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Someone is about to make a killing on Etsy. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I can see the SNL skits now. Baldwin as Trump going on about something, with someone as Pence just sitting on the fireplace staring head every so often slowly moving their head and creepily staring. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well that's because there was a woman present. You know he doesn't communicate with other women if his wife is not present.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He's just pencive. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Bizarre, watch the clip. 

Pence did not move a single body part for the entire 15 minutes. Not his arm, leg, feet, nothing.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ i loved when trump made a half ass attempt to undercut Peloci, and quickly shoots a look to pence like “fuckn got her dude”, and pence wasn’t even looking at any of them, practically in a separate room, miles away... most likely dreaming up future designs for his very own final solution. 

i was at the gym and never laughed so hard on a treadmill in my life!  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ 'Unused chalk' works too. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ with a huge evil grin on his face just like the dolly too I bet ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ he's the biggest hypocrite. deep down he's enjoying every second of the clash, thinking "yesss God's plan... I just have to keep quiet and I'll be president once this idiot is impeached" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Can somebody please explain to me what the fuck does Pence do anyway??? Fucking Jared does more shit than this stooge... continuosly looks like he's about to fall a sleep... whatever he is doing ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Haha, somebody likes reading the comments at TheRoot. The article called him a fireplace ornament, then this: https://imgur.com/twM0t4E

2. Definitely has the creepy soulless stare down pat. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Mike “I’m just here so I don’t get fined” Pence ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Does he have social media? Aside from reddit i myself do not. I would love to see his social media get flooded with how stupid he looks ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Oh God this awful meme ~end~

*****
> CNN&#039;s John Avlon on Tuesday said that Vice President Pence looked like an &quot;Elf on the Shelf&quot; while sitting quietly during an explosive Oval Office meeting between and Democratic leaders about funding for the border wall.

> In a tense meeting with House Minority Leader and Senate Minority Leader, Trump threatened a government shutdown if he did not get the funding he wants for a border security.

> ADVERTISEMENT. As Trump, Schumer and Pelosi sparred verbally, Pence sat quietly in the background, something that Avlon compared to the popular Christmas toy, the Elf on the Shelf.

  ~cmt~ Wasn't it in Comey's book where he made a comment about being instructed to never, ever show up Giuliani? That's Pence right now.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ About halfway through when Trump really started going off the rails, I have to imagine that grin of his, and an inner monologue of “Oh boy did I underestimate his idiocy. We’re all fucked.” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pence is elf on the shelf in several ways. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Isn't he always when Trump is running his big mouth?  He looks like he would give his right kidney for a "I'm with stupid 👉" sign.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Almost like one of the paintings behind them. Maybe less lively. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I was so happy when he finally shifted slightly to the left; up to that point, I thought he was a puppet.. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ More like Lurch. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Jeff sessions would like a word.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He’s a living wax figure on a god day.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pence was trying to become one with the chair.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I hope that means he was pulling a series of cheeky little pranks to the delight of children but I bet not. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Mother must be very disappointed! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pence does a remarkable job staying out of the news for the most part. Has he accomplished anything?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If there's one thing I'm certain of after that display, it's that Pence not only has experience but also enjoys silently watching a man get fucked from the fringes of a room. And I'm not judging him for it, just making an observation. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Santa, can I get a new kid?"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9EJSMG_cdo ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You can always tell a Milford man  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hmm  I wonder if Trump has thought about firing Pence.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Press Corps afterward:

“What, you can’t say one thing?! Even the guy who can’t think said SOMETHING! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I swear he looks photoshopped in. His position on the chair is so odd. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ link to cnn please ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He looked so uncomfortable ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ “Weekend at Pencie’s” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I liked the description that "Pence was trying to blend into the wallpaper."  Seemed fitting. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He knows he’s totally fucked and just doesn’t give a shit anymore. Hard to care about anything when you know your career is about to be ruined and you could possibly be in jail in a couple of years. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Vice cuckident.  ~end~

  ~cmt~ No, not the same.  It's worse. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Election fraud in NC can be grounds for a re-run of the election. Voter fraud cannot.

Also, the election fraud does not have to be at a scale that would change the vote. Ten instances of election fraud could invalidate an election even if they winning vote count was 100,000. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yo Republican voters, now would be a really good fucking time for you to step up and call this shit out, it would go a long way toward convincing the rest of us that you're *actually* interested in a government that represents the best interests of the people, and not just "winning". ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Oh that’s why republicans are silent on this! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Jesus fucking Christ I'm happy for this headline. Its been amazing seeing articles for the last week or more bemoaning voter fraud in NC. I get that our media loves to assume Americans are too stupid to understand nuance, but the difference between election fraud and voter fraud are huge and *super fucking important*.

An individual random na'er-do-well could theoretically commit voter fraud, or as evidenced by the case of [Crystal Mason](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/01/texas-woman-jailed-five-years-voting-probation), a totally well intentioned person could be sentenced to prison for committing it unintentionally. Broadly speaking, "voter fraud" is a political term used by the GOP to chase the spectre of some shit that isn't real.

Electoral fraud is a very real thing, a crime against Democracies committed around the world by corrupt elites with the ability to do so. *Electoral fraud* is the sort of thing that makes election monitoring make sense in developed and developing nations around the world. *Electoral fraud* has caused political unrest in countries and is a constant threat posed to Democracies globally. *Electoral fraud* is what appears to have been committed in NC.

Edit: mistyped C.Mason's name ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Glad this is finally getting some traction instead of the "OMG, GOP doesn't actually care about voter fraud, LULZ!" crap articles. They're fundamentally different. Especially since one actually exists.

GOP: "Be afraid of ghosts! Look at all the people they kill!"

Reality: "I think we should be more concerned about serial killers rather that ghosts, since we've never seen any evidence of ghosts ..."

GOP: "Nope, ghosts are real! Report any ghost sightings you see! Everywhere we went we saw ghost victims!"

Reality: "Yeah, about all those dead bodies that were found wherever you went ..." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It took this long for a publication to acknowledge this? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Someone call in the U.N., this is fucking ridiculous. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So I’ve been seeing a lot about a potential re-election.  I have a few questions I’m sure many of us would like answers to.  

Is there some sort of deadline for a re-election to occur? Or is this something Harris and the GOP could drag out in court? 

And if January 3rd comes around without any action taking place, would Harris still start a new term in NC, or could congress potentially block this? 

Since the election isn’t certified by the state, would district 9 instead proceed without a representative until it gets sorted out? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Is this somehow a complicated distinction? I've known it at least since 2006 and I'm not even American or a native English speaker. How can a native speaker mistake "voter fraud" to mean "fraud committed \*against\* voters"?  "Voter fraud" is when voters commit fraud, "election fraud" is when the election is fraudulent itself.

I'm flabbergasted how seasoned political reporters could mix this up, like [NY Mag](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/a2dcdz/north_carolina_race_roiled_by_claims_voter_fraud/) and even [Nate Silver](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteBlue/comments/a2v50w/nate_silver_moving_nc9_to_tossup_as_youve_seen_in/).

[ABC News](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/a27liz/north_carolina_board_of_elections_chairman/),
[Law & Crime](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/a2688g/is_a_doover_election_incoming_north_carolina/) and
[Motherjones](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/a2zron/republicans_finally_have_a_voter_fraud_scandal/) at least changed it to election fraud at some point afterwards.

This is a huge disservice to the discussion of the actual issue of election fraud. Republicans will just run with the notion, "see? Voter fraud is all over the headlines" and claim that it can be rectified by restrictive voter ID policies. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Finally! Someone gets the headline right.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Election fraud is way worse.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The Republicans in Congress are ignoring the election fraud in North Carolina, but are wringing hands that Google (a privately owned company, btw), are "censoring conservative voices" (ref: https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46521887 ) with its algorithms. It's good to see where their priorities lay. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Voter fraud is when someone with Alzheimer's tries to vote twice. Election fraud is when someone changes the vote tally to make the lawful winner into the loser. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Let’s not forget that this is at the hands of republicans.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ When white people cheat, no one bats an eye. 

When 1 Mexican votes, white people lose their shit.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's the same difference as someone robbing a bank and the bank robbing its depositors. Except only WE know who goes to jail first. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What people should take away from this is just how hard it is to detect this sort of thing - and how much of a problem that is.

Bear in mind that the accusations aren't just for this election cycle, but for previous election cycles as well. However, nothing could be proven. Indeed, it's likely that nothing can be proven *this* time.

Which should give anyone pause who might be tempted to support notions like California's "ballot harvesting" system. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Like Georgia? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ FUCKING THANK YOU!!! for explaining the difference. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Not the same thing.

No, it's a *real* thing.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Just food for thought.  This is a bad argument: 

>“Voter fraud” as conventionally meant by Republicans looks something like this: Somebody shows up at the polling place and presents false identification and then votes, thereby casting a vote that should never have been cast. The voter commits fraud.

Ok.

>That is not at all what allegedly happened in North Carolina’s Ninth Congressional District, where election officials have refused to certify Republican Mark Harris’s win over Democrat Dan McCready... voters have testified that people working for the operative took their ballots and said they’d finish filling out their votes for them.

Ok.  So is the distinction that voter fraud must happen in person?  Because if it's just voting for someone else when you aren't that person, that's precisely what appears to have happened in at least some of these cases.  

Obviously, it also appears there may have been disposal of votes, but this whole sentence undermines the argument that at least some of this was, in fact, voter fraud as defined by themselves. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Its a big club right  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > “The Republicans don’t win and that’s because of potentially illegal votes,” Trump said. “When people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It’s really a disgrace what’s going on.”

Truly the fevered rantings of an old, old man with mental health issues. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Does collecting half filled out ballots and finishing them yourself not also count as voter fraud? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ There's both.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Voter fraud really just seems to be an informal definition of a set of different types of electoral fraud. I don't think voter fraud has an official definition and I don't know if you can really say this is or isn't that with any real authority. All one can really say is that it's important to state the difference with  this instance versus what others commonly view as voter fraud. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You know you're in trouble when you're turning to Vox for news. 😂 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So California commits election fraud?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why is Vox carrying the Republican talking point.  The North Carolina election theft did include, 

voter fraud, submitting ballots, voting, illegally. Just because this voting,  was done in the names of hundreds, by a few individuals, does not mean it is not voter fraud. Illegal ballots, were submitted and counted, it is voter fraud. 

Just because it wasn't a long line of illiegal immigrants and unregistered POC, (what the Republicans claim every year), doesn't mean it isn't voter fraud along with election fraud (requesting the sample ballots, paying for the collection of those ballots, are the parts that are election fraud).  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I wish our side would stop trying to refine words.  Whenever you notice someone in an argument trying to do that, that means they're losing. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Remember all, this is officially a Trump shutdown. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump: "Give me what I want!"

Pelosi: "Go fuck yourself."

Trump: "Okay, give me what I want or I'll go fuck myself!"

Pelosi: "I said go fu...wait. What?"
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This fuckin idiot just gave Democrats campaign ads for the next two years.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm glad people got to see this today.

Even at this late, late hour. Some people don't get it.

Donald Trump is stupid. I mean literally and actually stupid. He's the most non-smartliest guy we've ever had in the public sphere, EVER.

There's no strategy, no grand scheme. He really is just a child. And I feel like it's finally penetrating to people just how true that is. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Good to see Nancy taking charge of the House a month early.

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ For the first time in 2 years people at my work are criticizing Trump.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Nancy Pelosi just proved that the best way to irk Individual-1 is to simply attach his name to something negative. “Nobody wants a Trump shutdown” certainly got his attention. 

Here are some more suggestions:

“Nobody wants a Trump marriage.”
“Nobody wants a Trump real estate deal.”
“Nobody wants to be a Trump lawyer.”
“Nobody wants a Trump eulogy.”
“Nobody wants a Trump Jr.” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >The first rule of shutdown fights is never say you are for a shutdown. Voters invariably oppose this kind of stunt and see it as evidence of incompetence and unnecessary rancor by the governing party. In short, since Republicans control everything and are likely to be blamed for shuttering the government, the last thing President Trump wants to do is say he is for a shutdown. And that’s exactly what he said Tuesday, no doubt to the joy of Democrats who are trying to convince Americans the GOP is unfit to govern. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Legitimately the only thing President Fuckstick had to do during the open meeting was make it seem like the Democrats were the ones responsible for the shutdown. In true Trumpian fashion, he ended that portion of the meeting red faced and yelling "I'm proud of shutting down the government, Chuck!" like the unhinged barely cognizant 5 year old that he is. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Mike Pence’s movement was so slow it was imperceptible.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Like any fight, Trump has lost. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I thought Mexico was supposed to pay for the stupid wall?

They need to play Trump saying he is "proud" to shutdown the government over and over. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Boy I can't wait to go home and see all the House/Senate members and pundits twisting over how to make "I'm proud to shut the government down, Chuck!" sound like a win for Trump in every news segment tonight. lol ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ 3D ~~chess~~ shitting yourself.

Bigly stable genius. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ There will be no wall. Your move Trumpo.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He gave it away, right from the get-go! Just like with obstruction. "I fired Comey because he was investigating Russia and Trump!"

"I'm going to shut down the government! Me! They'll call it the great Trump shutdown. People will love it. You've never seen a more beautiful shutdown. I know the Dems will try to take credit for it but I did it. All by myself."

  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >It was an extraordinary moment when Trump not only lost the high ground as president but made Democrats look like the grown-ups.

He didn't lose shit to his supporters, sadly.

He yelled a lot.

They'll see him as winning that debate, because that's what mostly happens to them. They rant. They rave. People try to respond with dispassionate logic and real thought. They rant. They rave.

Rinse and repeat. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > “Pelosi and Schumer repeatedly sought to end the open press portion of the meeting," CNN reports, "telling the President they should debate in private, not in front of the cameras. ‘Let us have our conversation and then we can meet with the press again,’ Pelosi said.”

1. They understand Trump better than he understands himself. They knew he would dive right into brinksmanship and how politically stupid that is.

2. The Democrats actually want to govern responsibly. This meeting in the oval office was a political win for them but if the government shuts down is going to hurt a lot of people. Pelosi came across as somebody who actually cares more about doing her job than scoring political victories.

3. The Republicans want to destroy government. What Trump doesn't understand is that you can't just say you are going to destroy the government. You have to fool the people into thinking that the government is fundamentally bad and can never work. Well when you look at the camera and say that you will be proud to shut it down then the con falls apart. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ They set him up and it was beautiful.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wasn't much of a fight, really.   He went on tv and said, "I would love a shutdown". 

Well... Dems can let him have it then.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Lol it was so funny watching Trump not clearly understand that he does not have the House. 

He was like “I’ll have the house in 2 seconds” and everyone in the room is like no......you don’t understand that you just lost 40 seats.... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ (Paraphrasing) "I'm gonna shut down the government one way or the other, through you, the military

_record scratch_ … the military? Schumer should have been like, the military? Burst out laughing and make a smoking weed joint gesture and the this guys crazy spiral index finger on temple ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Would the shutdown stop the Mueller investigation?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > It was an extraordinary moment when Trump not only lost the high ground as president but made Democrats look like the grown-ups.

I mean, I don't think "extraordinary" is the word I would use.  Maybe "commonplace" or "quotidian" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "The Art of the Deal" indeed. Mesmerizing. A true master at work. 



Seriously though, how can so many Americans be so fucking stupid? Far too many people won't see this. Far too many will and still believe he isn't a fucking moron. 

Another surreal day in Trump's America.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "When the government shuts down it will be my doing!"

"...oh, and also the Democrat's fault." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Federal employee here.

It will be nice to get a couple of paid weeks off around Christmas. Paychecks might get delayed if it's too long but we'll still likely get paid.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ https://i.imgur.com/oFg2wyk.png ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Also, Republicans still have control of **both houses and the presidency**. Democrats are still the minority and Republicans cannot even agree amongst themselves.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He can't get through a softball press op meant to make him look Presidential without going nuclear. How's he going to win behind close doors?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Schumer literally can not contain his glee.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well in typical trump strategy he has no option but to double down on his stupidity and shut the government down or now look weak to his base.

Backed himself into a corner as usual. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Do we think Trump even know what happens when the government gets shut down? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And Pence the fucking number 2 guy, during that whole session says *NOTHING*

Not even to back Trump ONCE and to me that speaks volumes. 

Can you imagine George H not backing Regan's points of view or stances? Or Biden and Obama? Lol. Damn.

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If he was not so bent on trying to "one-up" everyone, he would have been fine. They could have had there snarky remarks and ended it. But nope, he does not think before he speaks and shot himself in the foot.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I know the Trump machine is trying to spin this as a win.

But even they have to feel a bit embarrassed by this.  Their guy is supposed to be this great negotiator, and all he did here was whine and get pissy.  He made no deal, he got nothing done, and now he's going to shut down the government because he can't get his way.  (And wasn't Mexico supposed to pay for this idiotic wall?) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I would hate to work for a company where a CEO would say or do something like this. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Nuh uh!! Fake News. ~end~

  ~cmt~ No he hasn’t!  It’s Mexico’s fault! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump laid the wood on those Marxists.  Crying Chuck Schumer, the beta boy, couldn't even look Trump in the eye most of the time. And Pelosi and her babbling brook of nothingness is the gift that keeps on giving. (PSA: dont do too much botox, kids).  Majority WANT a border that is secure. Only a neoMarxist America hating useful idiot wants  third world rabble streaming over our borders, unvetted.  Now the cards are on the table. Shut this bitch down, Trump. #MAGA. ~end~

> Massachusetts has a dark history of punishing civilians who dare to record cops.

> For good reason: A long line of Supreme Court precedents confirms that the government may not &quot;Repress speech by silencing certain voices at any of the various points in the speech process.&quot; As the 7th Circuit explained, the &quot;Act of making&quot; a recording is &quot;a corollary of the right to disseminate the resulting recording.&quot; The &quot;Right to publish or broadcast&quot; the recording &quot;Would be insecure, or largely ineffective&quot; if the recording itself were banned.

> The Boston Police Department&#039;s official training material actually instructs officers that they may arrest and charge people who secretly record them performing their duties in public.

  ~cmt~ Then why put climate change deniers on TV at all??? I like what Bill Nye said about it when he said if you want to have a real debate about climate change you need 99 scientists vs 1 climate change denier because 99% of scientists agree on climate change.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It’s the same Crossfire mentality that Jon Stewart eviscerated 14 years ago. “Side one vs. side two. Fight!” It’s the sportsification of political debate, something CNN has long championed. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is the reason why CNN sucks. 

Not for the reason Trump cries about.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ CNN didn't stop inviting Jeffrey Lord until he tweeted *sieg heil*.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ CNN is going to get called leftist no matter what they do.

So maybe put some leftists and actual subject matter experts on. They probably won’t even charge an appearance fee.

“Today- how do we pay for Medicare for all and what are the benefits? The debate the Democrats are working through. We have Kyle Kulinski, co-founder ofJustice Democrats, Ted Lieu, representative from California, and Dr Patrice Harris, President of the AMA on our panel today.”

Hell, I’d love if an actual doctor turned up to the usual shitshow.

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Donald Trump is the mainstream media president. He is loved by Fox News & gets heavily promoted by CNN/MSNBC. I'm just wondering... where exactly is the left-wing media? Where is Kyle Kulinski? Where is Jimmy Dore? Every time CNN gets labeled as a "left-wing" organization I just laugh. Wolf Blitzer doesn't strike me as a radical leftist. He doesn't even come close to being a leftist in the first place. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why is CNN paying them then? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Their apparent need to have then is ridiculous. What's next? Flat-Earthers? People who dispute gravity? 

Don't give a seat to false science. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ They are just recording hours of blackmail against these fucks.

I like watching Santorum do frothy gymnastics to defend this pile of shit just to get shot down by conservatives and liberals (everyone else) with a functioning brain.

There must be a Santorum tape with Trump. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ CNN: "Now so that we don't appear too biased, here is a batshit crazy MAGA Fuckhead with an opinion" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So turn off CNN forever... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ At this point, anybody who even questions any details of climate change should face mandatory re-education, or jail time...their choice.

I mean, most children understand this. ~end~

> CNN posted a video on Monday evening urging people not to listen to climate change deniers, and instead pay attention to experts, like the channel&#039;s meteorologists.

> The problem is bigger than CNN. As Emily Atkin of the New Republic detailed, NBC also tried to &quot;Both sides&quot; climate science by having deniers on TV to talk about the National Climate Assessment.

> If CNN really wants to do something to stop people from listening to climate change deniers, there&#039;s a simple step they can take: Stop having them on TV..

  ~cmt~ There is something to be said about showing both sides of a debate, the BBC for example has to do so by law. However, this is not a subjective matter. I dont get why the BBC invites deniers, and i dint understand the discussion we have to have is whether it exists rather than how to fight it. There are no two sides, there is pretty much scientific consensus climate change is real. It's factual information. When the BBC does an item on a hurricane developing they don't invite people who claim it doesn't exist.

 Besides the serious discussions, there could also be some interesting debates with 2 actual subjective opinions. Talk about the morality of it all; climate change is bad for future generations, but there will always be some negative effect from billions of humans living, so how much damage are we "allowed " to do. Don't refute facts. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's like they're afraid to extremely piss off the Republicans so much  that they want to perform violent acts of hatred against the network. 

Oh? Somebody has tried to mail a bomb to them multiple times? 

Maybe they should just abandon that ship and call a spade a spade then. Is money still more important than the future of the world and your employee safety?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "And after the break, we'll talk to Tom DeLay and Rick Santorum to hear their thoughts on CNN's decision to urge people to ignore climate change deniers." ~ Also CNN ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I just choose to ignore CNN completely. I like to get my news from people who don't choose to exacerbate the problems we face. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's all evidence that the news media is just here for entertainment dollars and not to inform. It might be extreme but I'd be in favor of holding media companies accountable much like oil ones for climate change, as they're just as culpable. Spreading disinformation should be taken seriously, especially when it affects our entire civilization. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ HAH! What's next, CNN urges networks to stop broadcasting Trump's speeches? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is where I feel that Archer meme is totally accurate here..

“Is media the enemy of the people”

  ~cmt~ Don't watch CNN if you care about the climate. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I feel like wheb somebody is often wrong or likes to argue in bad faith, i.e. Rick Santorum, then maybe, just maybe they don't need to be given airtime, regardless of the position they hold/held. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Can this pit get any slimier? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It’s so crazy Rudy made a name for himself by taking on the mob and in the end he will be remembered for his associations with organized crime. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Guys what part of **legal** and *cool* are you not getting?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The media should just start asking Giuliani questions about this instead of questions about Trump. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Make Attorneys Get Attorneys ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ In addition to the stuff about Rudy, this article succinctly lays out how this administration's entire foreign policy is for sale. Just another part of the organized crime operation that is the Trump White House.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ FARA fucked.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is starting to sound like the plot of last season’s Mr. Robot.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ At the time of the Congolese reception, the Trump administration and the international community were pressuring Mr Kabila to step down, partly by intimating that his allies might face additional sanctions. Not only had he been accused of violent repression of dissent and looting millions, but he had overstayed the country’s constitutionally mandated term limits by nearly two years.The Congolese officials at the reception posed for photos with Mr Giuliani, and afterward there was some confusion about his connection to the lobbying effort.Francois Balumuene, the Congolese ambassador to the United States, suggested in an interview in September that his country was working with Mr Giuliani to figure out the administration’s position on an upcoming presidential election called by Mr Kabila to avoid threatened sanctions. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Rudy being shady? Unpresidented.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Emphasis mine. [Outline.com](http://outline.com/KDZ8Pj)  of the article for you mobile homies.  [Link](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/us/politics/sanctions-lobbyists-usa.html) to the NYT article the Independent reposted. 

>At the time of the Congolese reception, the Trump administration and the international community were pressuring Mr Kabila to step down, partly by intimating that his allies might face additional sanctions. **Not only had he been accused of violent repression of dissent and looting millions, but he had overstayed the country’s constitutionally mandated term limits by nearly two years**.

>**Francois Balumuene, the Congolese ambassador to the United States**, suggested in an interview in September that his country was working with Mr Giuliani to figure out the administration’s position on an upcoming presidential election called by Mr Kabila to avoid threatened sanctions.

>**“What I know is that it is possible that Giuliani will let us know how to go ahead,” Mr Balumuene said**. He referred additional questions about Mr Giuliani’s role to the country’s special envoy to Washington, Raymond Tshibanda, who could not be reached for comment.


...


>Mr Giuliani said he was not serving as an intermediary between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the administration. In an interview in September, **he initially said he stopped by the reception for a half-hour to “say hello to people” and to impress a woman with whom he had been dining by taking her “to the top of the Hay-Adams to see a Washington party” with a “great view.”**

>But **he later suggested he attended at least partly** because he was interested in exploring business opportunities, adding, **“We’ve always wanted to see what’s Africa all about.”**

>And someone familiar with Mr Giuliani’s business affairs said one of his companies has recently been negotiating a consulting deal to work in the Democratic Republic of Congo, possibly through Mer.

>**In text messages on Sunday, Mr Giuliani said “if I do it, it would only be security consulting” similar to what he does in other countries, not lobbying. “Beyond that, I can’t say anything other than you can assume if we are working in a foreign country, we are doing security – physical and cyber, anti-terrorism, emergency management.”**

...

>Less than a month after the Hay-Adams event, Mr Kabila announced he would not seek a third term in presidential elections scheduled for this month. While some Trump administration officials are concerned the elections are being tilted in favour of Mr Kabila’s chosen successor, the United States has not levelled additional sanctions against the country since Mr Kabila’s announcement – an outcome some lobbyists on the account are privately claiming as a victory.

>In October, **Mer signed a new $200,000 contract with a public relations firm called Sanitas International** that was co-founded by Christopher Harvin, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign who had worked in President George W Bush’s administration. **The firm is seeking to demonstrate to the news media that Mr Kabila does, in fact, intend to step down and hold free and fair elections.**

>The New York Times

  ~cmt~ DR Congo is a fucking horrible place.  I did some contracting at a company that did business there, and the more I learned about the shit that goes on there the more disgusted I felt doing business with a company that did business in the DRC.
 
Rudy trying to ease sanctions against this horrible government is slimy AF. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ All these fucking people are corrupt. All of them.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Now Congo is bribing the administration? who isnt bribing the administration? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Are any of these assholes linked to the United States?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Becoming a history teacher has always been in the back of my mind.  These scumbags are making me want to do it more and more so that I can make sure that future generations are taught that modern day republicans were pieces of garbage who sold out our country for some dollars. Teaching 9/11 is going to be fascinating.  "Now you see these two men, Bush and Guiliani, who the world is feting for their leadership?  One will lead the country into a disastrous war and will cripple the economy.  The other will become the lackey of a mindbogglingly dumb president and will sidle up to some of the most corrupt governments in the world.  Now let this be a lesson to you kids to never rest on your laurels." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I sure hope justice will be served and people open their eyes and don't make an immediate conclusion when they pick a candidate. Most folks I know who voted for Trump and etc... Like the fact he is a businessman and not a corrupt politician. Unfortunately now and days anyone who takes a politician job should be questions twice. The best way to protect your investment as a criminal to work on the higher archy of the government and hide and infest.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wait.  Giuliani, the top notch legal mind, and 100%-definetely-not-charlatan-hack, is involved in million dollar shady shit?! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So we can quit utilizing the hypothesis that these people are simply losing their marbles in their seniority. They're acting nonsensical in light of the fact that they're actually lawbreakers securing their own personal responsibility. 

This season on... Bog People. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If it's *Trump* that gets us to *finally* recognize the evils of foreign lobbying, I'm all for it.  Let's tighten up the rules so that this kind of pervasive nonsense is no longer allowed - not for Republicans, not for Democrats, not for 3rd parties. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Is every Republican politician corrupt?  Sure seems like it! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why are republicans so greedy and corrupt? Does anyone believe in service anymore? ~end~

Must be emberassing to consult on cyber security and have your tweet "invaded".  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ why are they even bothering with these 'shithole' countries? seems these shithole countries are attracted to shithole politics and lobbying.


"It is a perception that matches up with the pay-to-play mind-set that defines politics in many parts of Africa, Asia, the Middle East and the former Soviet states.

Everyone knows that jail is never fun for anyone and yet these guys don't think twice about risking their freedom. it's bad enough you don't live forever and with work you don't really see true freedom anyway, and then you are going to go do stupid dumbass shite and give up what little freedom you have? I don't get it. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Rudy is one of the most dirty of the dirty. He is good and quite smart about covering it up, but I hope they dig clear down to his level before things are over and sent him to prison also. He and Donny could be butt buddies! or give each other reach arounds.  ~end~

  ~cmt~ "The Art of the Deal" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wow, this was something different. Trump was absolutely fuming there.  ~end~

  ~cmt~ > “Yes, if we don't get what we want…I will shut down the government,” Mr Trump said.

> Mr Schumer then said: “We do not want to shut down the government.” 

It's almost as if Trump doesn't remember that shutdowns traditionally become arguments over who is to blame for the shutdown and thus didn't record the best soundbite for his side. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Does anyone know where we can see a full video of the meeting? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ holeee shit. I've never seen Trump look so impotent. 

Nancy knew the moment the cameras rolling she could control the narrative, and played him like a fiddle. Now everyone is saying “trump shutdown” and forced him to own shutting down the government. Even Chuck managed to show some spine.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ is there a video of this debacle? please let there be. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hey these stats he's reading about the wall are insane. WTF?

 That's some really insane shit. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > “Yes, if we don't get what we want…I will shut down the government,” Mr Trump said.

This is the GOP's mentality in a nutshell. Blackmail. Remember earlier this year when McConnell tweeted an image saying Democrats have to choose between DACA and CHIP?

The problem with that specific blackmail attempt was that CHIP was a no-brainer, because it would have saved Federal spending over a set number of years. Hell, our Fiscal Conservatives should have loved CHIP.

But the GOP used it to get what they want. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So just a regular day at the Trump White House? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump seemed to repeatedly say the same contradictory statement over and over again. 

"The house would give me the vote if I wanted it...but I cant because I need 10 votes from Chuck". Paraphrasing.

Again, immediately after: 

Pelosi: "The fact is you do not have the votes in the house."
Trump: "Nancy, I do" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >Asked what advice she had given the president, Ms Pelosi said: “I asked him to pray over it.”

Savage. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Loved watching Nancy and Chuck, especially Nancy, stand up to that idiot bully. Fuck him and fuck his Wall, go talk to Mexico jackass. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You could put any headline before, "descends into chaos," and it would still accurately describe the current administration. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He's losing is mind! 

[And I'm reaping all the benefits.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWk6JcheLMU) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He almost called border crossers rapists, callback to his escalator pitch to the American people. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ These past two years have proved he has no intention  of actually doing anything about immigration besides exploit the issue at the Democrats expense. Especially when his approval ratings are in a slump, like they are right now, he calls "Chuck and Nancy" to publicly fight with them on immigration. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What did he mean he will shut down the government by the Military part of his retort?

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ There is zero reason for the Dems to give Trump a single inch of border wall or any other crazy ass shit he wants now. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Just listening to the audio now on NPR, trump just repeats the some words over and over with no backing behind them, going on about winning the senate? He sounds like a fucking college football fan, oh but we beat you guys last week were better. Fucking disgrace to the office and the country.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pence looks like he’s jist waiting for trump to fuck off. And that scares me more.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pence didn't say a fucking word the whole time.

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Of course it does.  The breaking news would be if it didn't. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why the fuck did he choose to televise this? This guy is not leader, this guy is a child ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ His campaign promise was that he was going to build a wall and Mexico was going to pay for it. Throw that in his face when he threatens a government shutdown.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ that was great what just happened? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What about Mexico, Trump?  You promised us.  You said!!  lol  what a doofus. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why is he even meeting with Democrats about this? The GOP still controls both houses of Congress. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ FTA:
> In dramatic scenes that may have been at least partly staged to appeal to their respective supporters, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer repeatedly clashed with Mr Trump...

Later on in the article:

Well, what the fuck is this writing? Who's the one dramatically "staging" to appeal to supporters? ~end~

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The images coming out of this meeting are amazing ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Twice during this conversation, Trump said that migrants and asylum-seekers from Central America are beset with contagious diseases that pose a threat to Americans. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wait wait wait. He says they caught ten terrorists over a short period of time. 

Trump said they have ten candidates for chief of staff. 

Woah. 
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Someone should tell Creepy Pence that you're supposed to unbutton your jacket when seated. He already looks uncomfortable (possibly due to a woman in the room), no need to make things worse. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is an example of why good social and communication skills are important, especially in leadership roles! The president is a weirdly awkward person and it’s very embarrassing how weak of an image that portrays.

All caused by Trump. You could hear Pelosi and Schumer saying multiple times "why do we have to have this conversation in front of the press?"

  ~cmt~ Trump doesn't know how to act like a respectable leader. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Where is the funding for the military to build the wall going to come from? Wouldn't that still require approval via the budget? Obama promised to close Guantanamo, and he couldn't, because Congress refused to fund that particular project. ~end~

  ~cmt~ They have both houses and the presidency, why don't they build the wall themselves? ~end~

  ~cmt~ Hand on heart this is genuinely the most I've laughed when it comes to anything Trump related. What the hell was Pence doing, man? Why was Chuck Schumer sitting so awkwardly? Why the hell does Trump have to front some tough guy persona so goddamn much? This was hilarious. Trump is completely inept lmao ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The Bigglyest stupid President ever. \#1☝️ ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pelosi told Trump he doesn't have the votes in the House to pay for a wall. He's unable to process that and so denies it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pence just sitting there like a statue the whole time. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Can we get a man bites dog day?  Every day descends into chaos.  The almost unheard of days where Trump is tranqued enough to keep his mouth shut or reads from a prompter, he is hailed as finally becoming presidential.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >Asked what advice she had given the president, Ms Pelosi said: “I asked him to pray over it.”

I do hope she was joking. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ But it wasn't chaos. It was a glimpse at how Trump behaves in meetings, always trying to appeal to his fans, while not knowing how anything works and going back and forth on the same topic. "The border is secure thanks to me!" "So you don't need a wall" "No, we totally need a wall to secure the border." Meanwhile Chuck and Nancy played him like a cheap fiddle, obviously familiar with how he just says random shit, so you goad him into saying stupid things to use against him later. And speaking of prescription drugs, Sleepy Mike Pence is back on the Xanax. ~end~

This is the most bipartisan consensus on any topic, except possibly prison reform. The money flowing into Washington via privatizing necessary public infrastructure is drowning the voice of the people. Some finance reforms and corruption sweeps are in order.
 ~end~

> Legislation to restore net neutrality rules now has 180 supporters in the US House of Representatives, but that&#039;s 38 votes short of the amount needed before the end of the month.

> Net neutrality advocates previously said they needed 218 signatures by December 10 to force a vote.

> Democrats will control the House in January, but they would have to start over with a new net neutrality bill and would face a tougher path in the Senate, where Republicans increased their majority from 51-49 to 53-47 in the recent election.

  ~cmt~ One of the most fundamental principles of modern democracies is that *no one is above the law.* 

That’s hard enough to enforce, practically speaking, when highly-paid attorneys can deliver such different results to those who can afford their services. But you’re really asking for a corrupt oligarchy if you make those in power subject to a privileged set of legal standards.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yes that's why we have a president and not a king.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I never understood where people get the idea that a President cannot be indicted. I understand that there is the DoJ policy. But where actual law is concerned, where do people get this idea? Where is it written? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The 14th Amendment **demands** the ability to prosecute a sitting President. To hold otherwise deprives the other 329,159,515 Americans of their rights to equality under the law.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The same people who get all butthurt about regulations have placed all their faith in some lame department *memo* that says the justice department shouldnt indict a sitting president. 

Yup. A fucking memo.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > What my analysis adds is the basic point that no such policy could possibly be squared with the Constitution. For any attorney general to signal to subordinates that they cannot pursue the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president, regardless of the evidence against him, would subvert the way our Constitution makes good on the promise that, under our system of government and indeed in any constitutional democracy, no one is above the law.

This is what I’ve never understood about the “you can’t indict a sitting president” argument. You climb to the very top to represent an entire nation of people, and suddenly you’re not beholden to any of that nations laws, and furthermore, get a pass on past crimes? It’s a decidedly un-American way of doing things.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ **U.S. vs Richard Nixon**

  ~cmt~ I don’t even know why this is being debated. He’s a president, not a king. If he murdered someone, you better believe he’d be indicted while still in office.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The idea a sitting President can't be prosecuted is ridiculous. You're telling me if a President is caught red-handed standing over the body of a man he just murdered in front of a room full of people who all witnessed it, that the police will throw up their hands and say "Whelp... This is something *Congress* has to handle!"? Asinine. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Can somebody help me to decide if this is correct:

quotes from article:

> Here’s why: Our Constitution’s framers were openly concerned with the possibility that a corrupt politician might contrive to win the presidency by treason, bribery, fraud, or other criminal means. They said so.  

and in the next paragraph:

> Just think about it: The president and vice president run as a ticket. 

&#x200B;

In my understanding the framers have in intended the first part, but the original constitution didn't mean for President and the VP to run on one ticket. Adams and Jefferson hated each other but were forced to be President and VP together... Did they alter the constitution when they changed that and President and VP started running on the same ticket (probs somewhere in the early 1800's0?

&#x200B; ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I would hope so, or you kinda have a king situation going on.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Feel giddy that this is being discussed more as a real possibility by serious people. Incarcerate that Orange Goblin, save the world. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Of course it does. All this talk about Justice Dept policies not allowing it is bullshit. Surprise, surprise that political appointees won't prosecute the people that appointed them.

And all this talk that impeachment is the remedy is also bullshit. Impeachment is merely the process for removing the official from office. It is not a replacement for our legal system.

The founders contemplated this stuff. That is why they put a rule in that said lawmakers could not be arrested while traveling to or from Congress. If they had wanted to stop the president from being prosecuted, they would have plainly said so.

The Constitution defines the process to remove the corrupt official from office as impeachment. That does not prevent any government official from being charged and prosecuted for criminal activities in the normal courts. In fact, the Constitution specifically states...

*"Judgment in Cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law."*

The Constitution specifically states the penalty for conviction under impeachment goes no further than removal from office and the party can still be subject to trial and punishment after impeachment. That in no way excludes criminal prosecution for criminal acts while the parties hold office. Additionally, it even states...

*"The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed."*

That makes it clear that **all crimes** will be handled by the usual court procedures. The only exception is the impeachment trial to remove the person from office itself, not for any crimes that may be associated with an impeachment. Sitting judges can be impeached and they are still subject to criminal prosecution. No exception is stated to the rule that all crimes will be handled via trial by jury for any government official subject to impeachment. So there is no exception for the sitting president nor vice president. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He should AT LEAST be prosecuted for wearing those giant-ass clown ties. 

Looks like Clifford’s goddam tongue smh  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ben Shapiro is even saying they can indict him, and that Friday’s info is grounds for impeachment ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The constitution does allow prosecution of a sitting president. However, the corrupt GOP led senate does not. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Not to mention the 25th amendment is written to cover this prospect.

>In Case of the **Removal** (doesn't say how...) of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or **Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties** (by being indicted for example) of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President ...  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What about this fiction of a sitting president being "too busy" to be distracted by indictments or criminal proceedings? This jackass is the king of 'executive time' where we know without a doubt he's not doing anything. While historically unthinkable - is there not a mechanism whereby the president would need to prove he's actually busy? His schedule is publicly available. This guy goes to no meetings, does no work, reads no documents. He has nothing but time to sit through his own criminal trial. The government would probably begin to run as required. He's a do-nothing criminal hack. Let's proceed with the indictments.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ There is no conceivable way the founders of this country would have thought that a sitting US President was above the law and/or immune to it. 


 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ **Nixon was indicted.**

I'm going to be really annoyed in about four months when suddenly the press is banging the drum on this, because they sure as shit are pretending it's not important so far.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why is this even a fucking question? Oh, right, Republicans are fascists who hate freedom and democracy. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >I" think the state of the law just hasn't been decided. I see no reason why a sitting president cannot be indicted. I think the best precedent we have on this is the Paula Jones case, where basically the Supreme Court rejected the notion that the president is too busy to be involved in a civil case. That was the main argument that was made there - about the president being too busy. But the bottom line is this president has gone into federal court in Los Angeles, suing somebody who claims he doesn't know, and spends most of his time on a golf course. So the idea that he's too busy just doesn't cut it here." - Nick Akerman, former Assistant U.S. Attorney

The Paula Jones case was merely a civil case. This would be a criminal case, which would carry a higher weight to it. Precedent is clear: no one, not even the president, is above the law.

&#x200B; ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Of course it does. The idea that 'impeachment is the only remedy' is absurd; Congress isn't even in session all the time, so it can't be "oh this guy can get away with whatever the hell he wants until we all come back to DC and talk about it.' ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It does. But the DOJ is basically saying "our internal policy that has never been tested is more important than the constitution" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I never understood why in the world a President, sitting or not, would be held above the law of the land. That makes zero fucking sense.  The fact that it's even debated is a travesty and a mockery of the rule of law. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Honestly, if anyone is going to argue that the office of president is too important/busy to be indicted; they had better be able to explain all the golf and TV watching right away. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The Constitution also allows the people to rise up and overthrow the government if they are going against the will of the governed. That's why America is the land of the free ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Republicans are setting a dangerous precedent here by putting Trump above the law and ignoring all his crimes. The constant goalpost moving and mental gymnastics are quite sad. 

Just remember Republicans, if you choose to ignore Trump's crimes. You have to ignore Democrats' crimes should it happen. You're setting the precedent of putting a President above the law. Democrats are trying to set a precedent that no one is above the law.

  ~cmt~ Republicans are going to swear up and down that you can't prosecute a sitting President due to...reasons, and then they're going to turn around and charge the next democratic president with child endangerment when he sneezes while visiting a children's hospital or some shit.

It's obvious at this point the rule of law doesn't matter to them for anything other than how they can manipulate it for their own gain. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ yeah but in the photo he's standing you see.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Don't show him that or he'll just stop sitting and just alternate between standing and lying down. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump, due to the very fact of his criminality, endangers the country on a daily basis through speech and behavior biased by his personal legal concerns.

Even if there is a negative consequence to prosecuting a sitting president - which, yes, there most likely will be - the negative consequences of letting him be are already happening, and will keep happening until something is done about the fact that a criminal and foreign asset is running the country. ~end~

  ~cmt~ wow that meeting was a shitshow. hes a terrible negotiator  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Own it, you moron  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He is ridiculous. 

He didn't get this done when he had congress on his side, and now he wants to shut down the government over this?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's so nice of him to be willing to take the blame for once. I give it 3 hours before he reverses course and says it's the Democrats' fault. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wait, weren't we going to pay for it?

Man I can't imagine how much of an imbecile you have to be to be one of his cultists right about now. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I was literally listening to a right wing radio show and they were blaming the Democrats for a possible shutdown because they want "open borders". Now Trump accepts the responsibility?  Lmfao!

By the way, what happened to this morning's plan to have the army build the wall?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The government has essentially been shut down for two years now.
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The stock market is going to love a shutdown.  A lot of Republicans vote based on their investments.  One of my conservative colleagues is so disillusioned at his portfolio he was actively calling for impeachment without hesitation.  

I mean, it's a soulless way to make decisions, but it is a measurable one.  ~end~

  ~cmt~ Do it, pussy! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > If there’s not a spending deal this time around, only some government agencies would close because Congress has already fully funded most of the government through the rest of the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2019.

Trump acts tough when the stakes are minimal.... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Might as well tie your disgraced name to the upcoming global financial crisis while momentum is on your side, dumbass. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump and GOP have now lost any ability to blame the Dems. He is a spectacular fuck up.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The video is pretty remarkable.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Apart from the obvious . . .

Trump is so disrespectful with his use of first names.

Notice how Schumer and Pelosi say 'Mr. President', as they should and do to their credit, yet Trump persists with 'Chuck' and 'Nancy'. He does the same thing with world leaders *except* the authoritarian leaders like Putin, Kim, or Xi. It's 'President' or 'Chairman'.

Like Trump would have the balls to call Putin to his face or refer to him as 'Vlad'.

It is quite telling. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Do it you orange taint.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What an unhinged meltdown.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ [Video link](https://youtu.be/RZ82YmOM804) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ domesticenemyoftheconstitutionsayswhat? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ trump got schooled and it pissed him off. he needs to think about his health. Imagine being that old and angry all the time. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Goddamn people don't "sneak through" enough to warrant billions in funding. They come here legally through visas.

This is security theater more than anything. If stopping illegals was truely the goal he would be ranting about visa overstays much more than ths wall. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This fucking nonsense about not bring a bill up in the House if it doesn't have the votes in the Senate is one of the things must destructive to the country.  Pelosi keyed on the right response there.  You bring it up in the house so you have more competent people negotiating things, not an angry orange toddler who has never processed a fact in his life.  It's all about me win, you lose with this twat.  If it wasn't so embarrassing for Don the Con, I'd say they shouldn't even have went on camera there. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You heard it here folks! Any imminent shutdown is 100% on Donald J Trump himself. If the shutdown inconveniences you in any way whatsoever, just remember who wanted this to happen.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wow I didn't expect that he wanted a deeper grave for himself ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If I were Pelosi I'd walk into the meeting with a video montage of Trump shouting "Mexico's going to pay for it!" and sweetly assure Trump that the Democratic Party has no desire to put the President in a situation where he would have to back out of his campaign promise. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Schumer and Pelosi played him like a goddamn fiddle  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Democrats should meet Trump half way. He can have a Border Wall Development Fund that is filled with a US nickel for every peso that Mexico deposits into the BWDF. Donald then just has to go get half of the funds from Mexico that he originally claimed.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Remember the last government shutdown? When Schumer said he’d give money to the wall/border-defense in exchange for progress on DACA? But Trump didn’t go along with it and they had to reopen the government without him getting anything out of it? Master deal maker. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Fine. Shut it down. At least this piece of shit administration wouldn’t be able to put into action any of its crap policy. 

Does trump get that? If the government is shut down only essential services are operating. Everyone else stays home ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He's not even bright enough to blame the other guy.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump Shutdown to start his war on Christmas. I’m sure this will ruin the christmas’ of any struggling govt workers. The irony.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The art of the deal:  I need the wall, gotta have the wall, I want the wall, give me money for the wall, wall the wall wall wall wall wall wall wall, wallwall, wallwall, walwal.

President Walwal today had a stroke, and now the only thing he can say is "walwal" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Individual 1 has spoken... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Fuck Trump and his wall. The real threat to America is the traitorous GOP and their violent, bigoted supporters who shoot up minorities and mail ieds to political opponents. Not to mention aiding and abetting Trump’s attack on the law and the foundations of democracy.

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Meanwhile, Mike Pence the entire time:  "I've made a *huge* mistake..." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You can see the moment where he goes from trying (and failing) to not say anything stupid. Then the dam broke and gave the Democrats everything they needed. He handed them the shut down on a platter. Now if the government is funded, Democrats can boast that they focused on what mattered. And if there is a government shut down, there is zero doubt who is to be blamed.

&#x200B;

I hope if a government does happen, the soundbite of him taking the blame and not blaming Democrats is on every news channel, on repeat. I bet his followers are thinking, "he sure told me! No wall, no funding!" without realizing how idiotic that will be. Especially right before holidays.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If the past is any indication of what's going to happen people should be screenshotting everything right now. Twitter, Facebook, Reddit posts, all the people supporting this and cheering on Trump for threatening a government shutdown. Because once it happens everyone is going to call it the Democrat shutdown and blame Democrats for it. They did it for the shutdowns that happened when Obama was in the White House, they'll do it again. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Is this shutdown going to happen before January? It’s gonna be hard blaming the Democrats for anything, whether it be the shutdown or the lack of borderwall funding. I’m surprised the Republicans never pushed that through in these two years. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Does he know any other words besides *wall*? Jesus this is painful to listen to.

Edit: And he called Indiana **India**. Does this fucker not even pretend to know the country? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And this is when all of the republicans simultaneously face palmed.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ “Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Oh good, holding the government hostage for political gain, that always ends well. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Call that bluff. "The government" that shuts down isn't what they want people to think it is. The Army doesn't stop operating. Courts aren't adjourned. Law enforcement don't hang up their guns. Congress isn't blocked from meeting. The spectre of *The Government Shutting Down* only worked as a bluff before the first time they actually tried it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Mexico shuts down US government by not agreeing to pay for wall. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ 
You know what I'd like to see?  Dogs and cats living together in their own space station

  ~cmt~ you do you boy! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Reminder: He can't find a willing and qualified Chief of Staff.

Can't keep his own house in order so he's willing to threaten shutting down the government on live TV to distract from that. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Did they really do the Looney Tunes ["Rabbit season! Duck season!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-k5J4RxQdE) bit in front of cameras? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "psst. Mr. President, shutting down the government won't shut down Muller Investigation..." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Idiot probably thinks a shutdown means The Family (TM) can't be prosecuted. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I think Americans are already well aware of who is responsible for the failures of government right now. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ But... but... but Mexico is still paying for the wall, right?! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ ICE will be shut down, too.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Fuck this was brilliant for Pelosi and Schumer to take this and shine the light wholeheartedly at Trump's inability to grasp the basic concepts of negotiating. They came in and were clearly the ones informed and ready to not take shit from him. This is the most I have seen any politician truly stand up to him in person and in front of the camera. Don't think their intent was to have it devolve into that, but definitely didn't hurt their points. ~end~

I wouldn't agree with any of those myself but I could understand the reasoning behind it.

> Conservative commentator Ann Coulter lashed out at President Donald Trump for telling his supporters that sections of his proposed border wall are already built.

> On Tuesday, Coulter shared to Twitter a Washington Post Fact Checker article titled &quot;President Trump says his &#039;beautiful wall&#039; is being built. Nope,&quot; which stated that Trump has proclaimed the wall is being built, when in reality, it isn&#039;t.

> Alongside her tweet of the article, Coulter also wrote: &quot;Even a Washington Post reporter knows that not 1 inch of Trump&#039;s wall has been built. Does Trump think his supporters are dumber than a WaPo reporter?&quot;.

When Trump speaks using superlatives, I wish people would press him on that, because he doesn't seem to know the details on anything and is just bullshitting his way through every conversation. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yes, yes he thinks you are, Ann. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yes. Duh.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Honey, they are dumb. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I uhh...yes.

Wait...yes.

I mean...well, ya, yes. That's pretty much it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yes. Yes, he does. And yes they are. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It takes one to know one, ANN.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well they’ve seen past your Adam’s Apple this whole time and still listen to your hate screeds, Ann, so I’d say yeah. Pretty fucking dumb. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why is this dumb lady on my feed. Fuck off.  Dont care what you say, think or feel. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yes.

.


But is he wrong? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Oh this is precious.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yes. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Sometimes it feels like I am living through a random set of parallel universes. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Fuck Ann Coulter.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Duh ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ A good point I keep seeing Schumer raise, too, that I see nowhere else: what in the fuck is with this pressing need to get wall funding now? He's apparently spent roughly six percent of the funds allotted to him already, so why a rush for more when you haven't even used what you've already been given? What a stupid, whiny baby we have for a President. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yes. Also, I guess Coulter is calling his supporters dumb because they absolutely believe his shit.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Of course...as most Americans think. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yeah they absolutely are that dumb.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Dumb, cruel, immoral, garbage. Should I go on, skank.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Perhaps the question should be: "Does he think" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yes,

>!and piss off coulter!< ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ well yeah... where have you been? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Lmao yes. He is also an idiot himself. His rallies are just a yuuuge echo chamber of stupidity ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ downvoted and hid this because who cares what Ann Coulter says and newsweek is a terrible site to browse through ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Of course he does, Ann, and so do you. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ann Coulter has been serving up shit sandwiches & now is wonder why it tastes like shit. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Narrator:  Yes he does, because they are. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He knows they're dumb? Lol.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Came here for the 'yes' replies, was not disappointed. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yes he knows they are that dumb ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ann you know the answer to that question. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No, Ann. He doesn’t think they’re dumb. He is absolutely certain of it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yes ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ once again...anyone going to ask the man baby why mexico isn't paying for the wall? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well, duh. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It’s dark days when *Ann fucking Coulter* is a voice of reason.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yes because they are ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump supporters stupid? Nah. Neither are Hillary or Bernie supporters etc. At large. (some people, absolutly)

I think we need to stop calling so many names and say its OK to have differing viewpoints on things (diversity is what makes America great).

Are some people mis/un informed? Absolutely, so we should all calmly explain all sides of any giving argument and let people decide for themselves. But calling names like children sure isn't going to get us anywhere. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why yes, Ann, he does.  And for the record, so do we. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Everybody knows they are literally the most dumbest people on the planet. I mean there is not even hiding anymore what the Republicans are doing. You must be really blind and deaf or have a serious mental problem to accept this as your government. He can tell those crazy heads whatever he wants. But hey, Ann, you were one of them, why the hell are you surprised now? ~end~

  ~cmt~ These are people who think Google works like an old-timey telephone operator.  They think when you type something into the search bar, someone on the other end of the internet types in their answer. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ They really needed an explanation? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Because he's the dumbest US president ever? His own staff members call him a moron. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Idiot"  ??

Google would actually have to write a specific program to *limit* the number of Trump photos/articles showing on the front page. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I like the thought of how this started: 

"Someone Google some offensive names and see how long it takes for the president's picture to come up."

"Got one, sir, first try!" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Let me take a stab at this one, Trump is an idiot? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Glad this is on the Congressional record ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wait, so Google is liable for the way people use their product? Got it. 

May I have a word with Ruger, Sig Sauer, Springfield, Winchester, Beretta, Glock.... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ An easy troll of Trump on national news, while acting innocent.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Googling "Russian asset" also brings up Trump photos. So does traitor and treason. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Intuitive AI.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Congressman, Rex Tillerson or John Kelly might have a better answer  to that question." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Rick Santorum is probably frothing at the mouth or somewhere and thinks this is shitty of the American public. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He's so dumb that his picture shows up next to the definition of "idiot" on dictionary.com ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ We did it Reddit! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Damn that question is not going to help either. You just related “idiot”and “trump” with a billion new articles/comments  that will get published.


Including this comment LMAO
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Check it out, the word "idiot" is trending in Google.

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Because it's only rightful the king of idiots be displayed... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ My favorite part about this is that all the news sites reporting it online are only going to reinforce the correlation. It's the Streisand Effect amplified by media reporting and cast in stone by search algorithms. His new brand of the people, by the people, for the people. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Because algorithms deal with facts. Something Trump doesn't understand. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Because Google doesn't control the Internet.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's because news articles, social media comments, videos etc. all have the word idiot associated with Trump. It is what it is. I would bet racist would bring up King. It's an association. Not a man behind a curtain.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Because he is an idiot. Now they are for asking. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hilarious.  Uday and Qusay come up too.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Funny thing is that this whole spectacle is only going to increase the link between Trump and "idiot" online.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Maybe trump should try not being one.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You did it, Reddit :) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I mean it's the same reason googling "galaxy" brings up a picture of the Milky Way.

This is not rocket science. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "That's because Trump is a wonderful example of an idiot. Right then. We done here?"
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Listening to the questions I wonder if they actually believe the things they do (like gutting the ACA, or reclassifying nuclear waste) are popular with the general public and it's just a handful of nerds that make them look bad. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "You really wanna know?" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Because our AI works." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I think it's because Trump is an idiot... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Type "idiot" on Google and DuckDuckGo. Click on "Images", and compare. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Apparently they are envious. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ We should just all continue improving its accuracy by searching for idiot. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ AHA!! The true reason for the investigation!!!

Time to rig this system with moron, dicktater, criminal, lyin' lobototrump.... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Because even first graders know it is because Trump and his GOP are idiots.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Because he’s an idiot, most people think so and subsequently wrote on the internet about it? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Really.   Everyone here needs to type into google Trump is a dumbass, non-stop for a week. Please. ;) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If the boot fits... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He should have turned on that press conference on his phone. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Rofl  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is what people most likely are looking for? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It’s called [Occam’s Razor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor). ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ a while back, the reddit community made the image search return a swastika or something when you google some specific person, i don't remember who it was. some times it's just trolls. but maybe if all your news articles are about someone being a jackass, maybe they're just a jackass. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What a waste of time. 

They're a private company, right? If they'd answered "Because fuck Trump, and fuck you, that's why", what difference would it have made? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Have you heard Donald Trump?"  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Because THEY are idiots as well. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The biggest idiot of all time, some say in the universe. Big League Idiot! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ They went through all of it. They were in their 40s when the Internet became mainstream. How is it possible to  go through life being so  stupid? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yep. Accurate.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ When you google "sunshine", why do pictures of Miami show up?

You can't explain it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hey you know what happens if you look up idiot in the ~~dictionary~~ google? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Easiest question he had to answer all day. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If you google "cheesecake" pictures of cheesecake comes up. You can't explain this!?!?!? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Googled it, can't stop laughing. Holy smokes, Idiocracy was a Documentary.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Every time Someone clicks on a search result it tells Google it's a good match for the search. That factors into the results next time they get the same search. Lots of people must be clicking on pictures of Donny after searching for idiot.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ In all fairness, when I google "idiot" a picture if a rock, and Kanye West ALSO come up along with all the pictures of Trump. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Could it be because he's an idiot?

Where to I collect my prize money? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What congress should be asking is why so many people are image searching "idoit". ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Because he's the best example of an idiot the internet could find ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well, the GOP did that.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Reason: Reddit ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is why we need some new blood in Congress and kick out these old farts out of the government. They spent our tax money on BS. Waist everyone time and make news media busy and in business.... they don’t know how web and search strings work... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's funny that Trump thought there was actually any good news about him that he thought it was bias against him.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The internet does have a left leaning bias because the majority of its users are left leaning, the same way colleges are left leaning because pretty much only left leaning people go into teaching. The same way the military has a right leaning bias because only conservatives join the military. And trade schools are a political because it’s just men trying to get good paying jobs. Both the internet and the military are important. The difference here is that the military is controlled by the government which has both ideological stances, but the internet has nobody in control besides the money hungry corporations and leftists. So it gets more and more skewed as it’s importance grows and what is allowed is pushed farther and farther left. So basically we are all fucked and state enforced homosexuality for white people will be enforced by 2070 so that the only population growth in the US will be frome the immigrants and POC who are, let’s just face it, better than white people. Because diversity is our strength. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is as much a sham as the Zuck interview was.

We need young candidates to run on the ICE AGE Platform: to remove the Dinosaurs from office. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's because google is seriously biased towards the left, it's all left wing propaganda. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Wow, it's almost like Orrin Hatch is a sleazy, lying weasel. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This man has been a hypocrite since he ran for office on 'term limits' almost *half a century ago* ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I hate Hatch. I absolutely hate Hatch. He can’t be gone soon enough. Only a few people I hate more. 

I am just pissed that Grassley is Pro Tempore now. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Orrin hatch is an asshole. Glad he’s outgoing.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ im gonna ignore the first part since we all know Republicans are hypocrites.  How the FUCK can anyone consider Trump is doing a good Job as President? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Orrin's position matches the Republican position, which is, in essence, all is permitted as long as it's coming from an R. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Rot in hell, Orrin Hatch ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ As an atheist sometimes I wish the religious stories these people claim to follow are true. That way they will get to face their gods judgement for being scum. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Republicans  only care about crimes when Democrats commit them. And they don't actually care about the crime, they just care about removing a Democrat from office.

The party of law and order, folks. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ A republican being a hypocrite? I never thought I'd live to see the day. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Weird. It's almost like Orrin Hatch is a piece of shit. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >Committing crimes of moral turpitude such as perjury and obstruction of justice go to the heart of qualification for public office. These offenses were committed by the chief executive of our country, the individual who swore to faithfully execute the laws of the United States. This great nation can tolerate a President who makes mistakes. But it cannot tolerate one who makes a mistake and then breaks the law to cover it up. 

orly? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Orin hatch was born in 1934. Enough already.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hatch, along with Ryan, Graham, and McConnell, all need to disappear for the rest of our lives.  Let them go live in a cave somewhere.  These men are absolute selfish, venal sycophants to Trump.  Everything has to do with them getting theirs, and fuck everyone else. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pieces of shit are gonna piece of shit. Hatch can go shove his golden plates up his magic underwear. Douchelord.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I hope this piece of shit traitor has a miserable retirement that ends very early. In the meantime we're still paying him and his healthcare.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If this doesn't sound like Fox News, I don't know what does.  Ladies and gentlemen, U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch: [https://youtu.be/Y9Ldkn5UDsI](https://youtu.be/Y9Ldkn5UDsI) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I like that the Justice Department is now “Democrats” so we cant count on them to enforce like actual laws. Only Republicans can judge other Republicans.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Bill Clinton *actually* did a good job as president, Trump is doing an awful job.

We need a new ventriloquist for this puppet. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump has done an impressive job of unmasking the GOP leadership and revealing them for the pack of cheap whores that they truly are.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Clinton got impeached for lying about a BJ, but now, Trump lies about paying off women, and it's not a big deal. 

The hypocrisy is so annoying. The GOP is so corrupt, they aren't even bothering to try and hide it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I didn't commit any crimes. Okay, maybe I committed crimes, but I did a good job, so who cares if I committed crimes. Next up: I wouldn't have committed all those crimes if it weren't for you, the real law breaker. See now you're just like me, we're both criminals, so being a criminal is okay. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Another day, another example of "laws only apply to Democrats" from Republicans.

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Dereliction of duty. He shouldn't be able to hold the office. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Orrin Hatch is a terrible person. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ TL;DR: Yet Another Repubican Proven a Spineless Hypocrite with Zero Ethics ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ who is "Trump doing a job as president" for? It's not for 99% of Americans or even America for sure.  The only people benefiting from Trumpp as President are the 1%, Russians, and Saudis. Shame on Orrin.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Another GOP that will soon be dead and forever remembered as a piece of shit. 

Boys like him don’t really get this whole “social media/internet thing” and assume that getting a bronze bust of themselves in front of a government building or some obscure “for rich students” library will secure their legacy. 

Other then those fools who are pretending to like his ilk to spur the rise of a fascist state there’s no one that either knows who he is or doesn’t outright loathe and disparage him. 

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He's not doing a good job though...  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Orin Hatch is a perfect caricature of the modern GOP. Imagine if HRC had been accused of any of these things by the prosecutors. Just imagine. These guys would be fuming at their mouths and breathing fire nonstop.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Is there a movement to publicly shame and ostracize the family members of these low life politicians? There needs to be. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Fuck you Orrin Hatch. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ By what fucking standard is he doing a good job???  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Orrin Hatch is both incredibly emblematic of the GOP and one of the worst lying, flip flopping, pieces of shit in the world ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ For years, those on the Left have been shouting that the GOP is morally bankrupt and intellectually dishonest. But the mainstream press have shut their ears, stuck their heads in the sand and continued with this fallacy that "both sides are equal" or at least that both sides are acting in good faith. Now the videos are coming out and the lies are being exposed nakedly and they are realizing what we've been trying to tell them for years.

&#x200B;

It's similar to how minorities cried for decades that cops were killing unarmed citizens and getting away it. But nobody believed it. Even if supposedly liberal (read: white) circles, the topic was verboten. It was the dead people's fault. They made ALL the excuses in the world; they didn't believe the data. They didn't believe the anecdotes about black parents having "the talk" with their children. Then the videos started coming out and slowly the tide is turning. And minorities are saying "about damn time!". 

&#x200B;

I am not surprised Orrin Hatch doesn't care about Trump's illegal acts...he didn't care about Clinton's either. They just pretended to care so they can railroad him out of office. How do I know this? One of the guys in charge, Henry Hyde, had his own sexual indiscretion. Except he called it "youthful indiscretions" even though he was in his 40s and it lasted 7 years!

&#x200B;

> "The statute of limitations has long since passed on my youthful indiscretions," Hyde said in a statement. "Suffice it to say Cherie Snodgrass and I were good friends a long, long time ago. After Mr. Snodgrass confronted my wife, the friendship ended and my marriage remained intact.  

"See...no harm done I cheated on my wife with a married woman, her husband found out but I managed to keep my marriage intact. No harm, no foul. Let's get this Clinton guy!"

&#x200B;

&#x200B; ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ By their own stock market metric, Republicans are sucking at the economy ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "anything can be a crime under these laws"

&#x200B;

Wtf does that incoherent ramble even mean? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Orrin Hatch is a shameless coward. Fuck him to hell, honestly. He deserves eternal disgrace. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Sen. Hatch cited the economy as evidence that "Trump is doing a great job" as President.

Last week Wall Street lost a trillion dollars of value.

So, no. Judging by the economy, Trump is not doing a great job as President.

Just one more thing Sen. Hatch is wrong about. Continuing his decades-long streak. I'm glad he's retiring. He never justified his serving in the upper chamber. A complete waste of space. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ “you can make anything a crime under the current laws” says old man responsible for making current laws.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Never believe a Republican again. If the good ones ever want me to take them seriously they need to go start themselves a new party. They stood bye and let this... their current party become the monstrosity it is today. May the Republican brand forever wear this taint. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Orrin Hatch is a lying hypocrite.  He always has been. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ 20 years ago the president wasn't held accountable for his crimes. Since then, no president or vp (Cheney) was held accountable for their crimes. What makes you think this time will be any different?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ dont wish him harm, but i look forward to urinating on his grave and putting up signs that say traitor his country where flowers go one day. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's not just Orrin Hatch. The entire Republican party believes in this form of morality. Mitch McConnell knows what he's doing when he calls Democrats obstructionists after deciding to block Obama on everything on day 1. And the Republicans went along with it. He knew what he was doing when he said Democrats were stalling on the Kavanaugh nomination, after blocking Merrick Garland for nearly a year. And the Republicans went along with it.

The Republicans will always act against democracy because they don't believe in democracy. They are fascists, authoritarians to their core. And if you don't believe me, read up on Weimar Germany. At the risk of invoking Godwin's Law, there are many parallels to 1920's Germany and today in terms of the path to authoritarian rule.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The correct follow up question would have been: if he were doing a poor job as president would crimes matter? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Is he, Orin?  IS HE? Come on Orin. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Translation: Trump *appears* to be  implementing The Agenda^TM for The Base^TM . ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ How can Hatch actually say anything as he gargles Trumps cock? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Once again for those in the back, Republicans do not care about you, the constitution, or the rule of law. They only serve the ultra rich. Period, full stop.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well what's really a worse crime? Conspiracy with a foreign power to influence an election or lying about a blow job? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Orrin Hatch is a hypocrite and no one is surprised. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I will not morn Hatch's passing when it comes. What a shit stick.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Name change, GOHP, Grand Old Hypocrite Party ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ But ... but ... but Orrin, he's doing a __FUCKING GAWDAWFUL JOB AS PRESIDENT  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ There’s that Mormon morality for ya.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ copy and paste from another comment I made on this same subject in a different post.

"Just so people are aware. Hatch is retiring at the end of the year and did not run for re-election. Ever since he has decided to retire...and even for about a year before it...he stopped giving a shit about anything. His constituents would try to call and write and would get nothing but dead air back. Often, his phones would go to voicemail only to have the voicemail report that it was full. This would go on for weeks or months at a time. It has honestly been years since he has cared anything about what people outside of washington actually want or think. I would put the time around the beginning of Obama's presidency. It has only gotten worse over time. In fact, I would be surprised if after he retires that he will return to utah. I suspect he will stay in washington.

As for the people of Utah voting for him for so long. A large reason why he has held onto his seat for so long is because the state is overwhelmingly republican. I'm not positive, but I think there have even been elections that he was unopposed. After awhile people voted for him because it's what they have always done...and largely because he had so much clout in washington. Sometimes that would outway any political beliefs." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hatch  got the tax breaks his masters wanted, and is being richly reward by them. Thats about all he means by "doing a great job" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What do you call someone who has been in the senate for 15 years?  

&#x200B;

Massive hypocrite  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If hypocrisy could be sold by the pound, the GOP could erase the national debt in less than a year. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Orrin... my man... you fuckin up  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Can we stop acting surprised that republicans, and this asshole in particular, are hypocrites?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I say, tar and feather all those treasonous rats and strip them of their pensions.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Let’s not obsess about a Senator who is in a weird religious cult and is leaving the Senate in 3 weeks.  Hopefully his fellow-Mormon replacement will have some balls.  Doubtful.  But maybe. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Classic Republican hypocrisy from the party of treason ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Even if you were conservative I can't see how you could think Trump is doing a good job. What campaign promises has he come through on? What has he done better than any other conservative politician? All his scandals are self inflicted, and he's totally lost the narrative. Democrats got their biggest win since watergate this midterm, and the GOP brand is tarnished. 

If they had just picked Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz they could have got so much more of their goals done. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hatch will burn in hell for his crimes against humanity  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Can someone please explain to me what is "good" about the job he's doing? I mean outside of executive orders?  The only thing I can see construed as "good", at least for his base, is giving his base something to hate, propping it up like a papier-măché dragon and fighting it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Definitely thought the president was holding a JUUL lmfao ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What does anyone expect from the guy who kept Morton-Thiokol in bidness after they killed the Challenger astronauts?  Americans are expendable when bidness/political considerations are in play. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I Googled "pro tempore" and a picture of Orrin Hatch popped up. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Justice is only just when I want justice.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why do voters keep electing these geriatric assholes without a shred of morality? Yes Hatch is a pile of garbage, but so are the idiots who keep electing him. It sickens me to think people are so tribal or stupid to abide this level of rank hypocrisy. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ One of the slimiest monsters in the swamp. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Is he holding s juul? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The Familiar Message:  **T*****he law is just another stick to hit your political opponents with.***  *We don't actually respect it unless it suits us.  Anyone else feeling the same way is a criminal and deserves a "get tough on crime" mindset.*

&#x200B; ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ When is Hatch up for re-election?  There have to be enough moderate GOP supports that don't like him being the POTUS' shield. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What universe does someone inhabit for them to look at Trump and think "that's a good president"? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yet another appeaser and a feeble coward. This should educate us all on why we need *term limits* for the Senate. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ At first glance it looks like trump is holding a /r/juul ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump getting an aide to put a new pod in his Juul. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Oh, so a hypocrite like nearly every other Republican? Bad if a Democrat does it but eh, it’s okay if a Republican does it? Typical. I expect nothing less.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I can count on one hand how many public republicans are not corrupted by greed or power.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This coming from the man who thought women could biologically shut-down rape and STILL managed to get elected. Like what the actual fuck? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What he meant was "I don't care because he's a republican." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Except he's not doing a good job. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump is actually not doing a good job as president though.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wow. This doddering old fool doesn't even get that Trump isn't doing a good job. 

The scary part is he sounds exactly like Grand Maester Pycelle. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Sad that, in 2018, this level of hypocrisy is simply called "Tuesday". ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Narrator: but he wasnt doing a good job as president ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Fuck that quote. Literally. Right in it’s hole. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wait, he is? Since when?

Hatch knows we're talking about Trump now, right? It's been years... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Corrupt to the core  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Someone is gunning for that Chief of Staff position ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hatch is trash ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Does anybody doubt it's been pure partisanship all along? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Good job?  I mean sure if that job is to take up space and sign the things you tell him to.  He almost always does that. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If Obama had even been accused of a 1/3 of what Trump has, Hatch would be among first calling investigation, if not far worse. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ r/hatchcriticizeshatch ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Who you get your medal of freedom from matters.  If you got yours from Trump, sorry, but it's kind of meaningless when the likes of Orrin fuckin Hatch also receives one.  What in the fucking hell did he do to deserve that?  Blow hot air up Trump's ass? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ To be fair and equitable, the Democrats were the same as Hatch with Clinton. 

Neither party is right to do this, what is good enough for the goose is good enough for the gander but this position is not surprising ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yawn....still waiting for the iM-bEAcHmINt ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ hatch - like the rest of them - is a partisan politician to the bitter end

you will no sooner see him make a move against a GOP president than Pelosi would a Democratic one

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Clinton should have been held accountable for his crimes.  The fact that he wasn't set a precedent that Conservatives have used to excuse Republican crimes ever since. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Both Republicans *AND* Democrats are going to regret what they said during Clinton's impeachment. 

The shoe is on the other foot for Dems, because the main argument being made at the time was that it was a *private* personal matter (his affair with Lewinsky) between him and Hilary. That he only lied about it because that's what any of us would do. 

That is essentially what happened with Trump, only he had the means to try to pay off the women. Women, mind you, who entered into consensual sexual relations with a very known married man. The campaign finance violation is extremely esoteric in terms of what the American public will understand and I'm calling it now: **if the Democrats stupidly try to impeach him over just this issue, it will fail big time.** It will take 21 Republican senators to cross the aisle and vote to convict Trump. They won't do it for this. 

Everyone better hope that Mueller has a much better case for the collusion and obstruction issues in order for a successful impeachment of Trump to happen.  ~end~

George Papadopoulos, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Avi Berkowitz, Felix Sater, Jeff Sessions, Carter Page, Roger Stone, Michael Caputo, J.D. Gordon

Edit: Format ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He misspoke. He meant "No, collusion!" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ [Here is Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/11/trump-denies-any-links-to-russia-no-loans-no-nothing.html) swearing that neither he or any of his "great people" have had anything to do with Russia.

Or at least one of the times. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Manafort lived in Trump Tower during the presidential campaign. He spent days on end plotting with Trump per his own daughter. At the same time in 2016, he was meetiing with assange. Also, the Steele dossier alleges Manafort is a Russian agent in close contact with the GRU (Russian Intelligence). 

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ In the interest of fairness, here is a comprehensive list of Clinton associates and family who had contact with the Russians during the 2016 campaign:

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He was saying "Know Collusion" all along! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ very legal, very cool talks with the Russians. totally not about influencing the election, all the meetings were about making the best beef stroganoff. FAKE NEWS!! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ At this point I really want him impeached and convicted just so I can shove it in the face of all the assholes who still think he is so great. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "No collusion? Oh I thought you were saying no CONFUSION! We are smart. The smartest ever! We had zero confusion with Russia!" - probably Trump ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Jared Kushner attended the Trump Tower meeting with Veselnitskaya in June 2016. He was also accused of trying to arrange a “back channel” through which the Trump campaign could communicate directly with the Kremlin without the knowledge of U.S. intelligence agencies."

&#x200B;

Trump supporters have only made me realize that Einstein was right when he said, "stupidity is infinite". ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yeah but if you don't take all of those into account then there really has been nothing. 

 - Trump supporters ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The reason why Russia targeted the Republicans is because they are stupid and evil enough to sell their own country for a buck.

Treason. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No mention of Cohen's supposed trip to Prague, here? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No Smocking Gun, Witch Hunt, Thank you! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Donald's guilt is as obvious as his stupidity and his obesity. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Does he even know the definition of the word collusion? My money is that he doesn't and is just using it to sound smarter than the scrambled egg he truly is ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ ['No Collusion'? Who Had Contact With Russians During the Trump Campaign](https://www.newsweek.com/collusion-trump-associates-family-members-1252693)

*****
> As special counsel Robert Mueller&#039;s investigation into the Trump campaign&#039;s alleged collusion with Russia gains momentum, increased scrutiny is being aimed at all the Trump associates who had contact with Russians during the 2016 campaign.

> In total, at least 16 different Trump associates had contact with Russians during the Trump campaign for presidency or during the transition into the White House.

> Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions was among the Trump associates to have contact with Kislyak, the former Russian ambassador, during the campaign.

  ~cmt~ You can already see the good looking genes wearing off and the bulbous orange genes beginning to take over in ivankas face  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wow, some folks seem really worked up about this. Hey when you guys are told what to post do you have to translate the text from Russian yourselves or is that done in Moscow? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ \* so far. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Drain the swamp!" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ it's called conspiracy but go on  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Calm down everyone! There's more than enough Witches to go around... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Comey’s testimony from Friday was an interesting read. Particularly the back and forth over the crime of collusion and how Comey (to paraphrase) has no idea what collusion is or means and he has never heard that term in a criminal sense in all his years at the justice department. 

Trump says collusion because he can’t say he didn’t conspire or commit treason. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ “Folks, I know a lot of people okay? And who could have known who was working with my campaign, it was a lot of people. Anyways, those 16 coffee people didn’t mean to buy the coffee from RUSHER” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ All the ones we know about... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ New Order needs to come out with an update to *Confusion*, renamed *Collusion* of course.

You just can't believe me  
When I show you what Putin means to me  
You just can't believe me  
When I show you what \[I believe\] you cannot see ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So how many russian babies have been adopted so far? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This sounds like a bad 80s spy movie. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The goalposts have moved. Now they are admitting collusion, but saying it wasn't conspiracy.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Can somebody ELI5 why everyone keeps calling it collusion instead of conspiracy? Honestly curious. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ was there "synergy" between the campaign and Russia? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ We need an easy to read graphic or the playing cards like they used during the Iraq War.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The end is nigh. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ For the sake of comparison (and not that she matters anymore) but was there any contact with Russians during the Clinton campaign? Like a simple legal contact with an ambassador or something similar. 

Also did either Obama campaign do anything similar as well? Is it standard practice as a presidential candidate to meet with associates of foreign powers? I realize that the Trump campaigns contacts appear of nefarious nature (especially since they've lied about some contacts) but is there any precedent to meeting with at least one Russian during campaigns? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hillary paid Russians to get dirt on Trump. Trump people met with them at their request. Collusion? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You guys must be stoked. I know I would be if I waited three Christmases for a present. Either Mueller Claus doesn’t exist, or the liberals have been on the naughty list for three years.  🤔There’s always next year! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ LOL "contact with Russians"

What about contact with Germans? Or Pakistanis? Or Israelis?

This is still absurd. Being in contact with "Russians" is not the same thing as conspiring with the Russian government to throw the 2016 US election. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ [removed] ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wake me up when Rob reveals the Smocking Gun ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Did you happen to see the hearing today where the CEO of Google stated that the entirety of "Russian Collusion" added up to $4,700 worth of ad space purchased by Russian entities?

$4,700.  Total.

That's less than I make in a month.  That is what you people are going crazy over.  Less money than it takes to buy a used pickup truck. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hillary Clinton selling a boatload of uranium to Russia doesn't matter though.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ How come there is ZERO evidence of any collusion after 2 years of official investigation then? If so many people were involved, something would be found and leaked. Until then, this is just FAKE NEWS. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Now do Germans or Chinese...     
      
He was the RNC nominated presidential candidate. His associates are supposed to reach out.      
Vague illusions implying guilt in some vague crime are great for partisan mobs like we have on this sub, but if you want Trump to be punished, you'll need to prove an actual crime rather than continuously implying crimes. Good luck ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Now that Mueller has proved beyond any reasonable doubt that Drumpfh is a Russian agent, why aren't we marching on D.C to physically remove him from office?? If not now, when? If not /politics, who? Rise up, dweebs all over the world! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This collusion stuff is a bunch of baloney ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Is that a crime? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And that’s how Hillary forgot that there really is an Electoral College.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Collusion to do what crime? Collusion by itself is not a crime . Without any evidence that lead to Donald Trump this  is only media speculation for public consumption. ~end~

  ~cmt~ >	According to NYT, both Kushner and his wife, adviser to the president Ivanka Trump, had lobbied for Ayers to be made chief of staff for months, which many saw as a "coup attempt." 

>	Rather than dismiss Kelly himself, however, Trump reportedly "looked for others to do the work for him last week," even attempting to "arrange for" Ayers to fire Kelly, the newspaper reported, citing three people familiar with the events.

Our Administration’s workings in a nutshell, ladies and gents.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Muellers doors are always open John.  They even appear to work federal holidays  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Kushner and ivanka are slimy as hell.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So... Kushner and Ivanka are at the top table again? The Bob Woodward books goes into good detail explaining how they were being marginalized, and the power struggles around Trump. My guess is; this is due to Kushner's relationship with MBS.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ [Kelly's firing](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-wanted-someone-else-fire-furious-john-kelly-report-1253034) probably has to do with protecting MBS.  He was probably counselling disassociating Trump Administration from MBS, while Kushner wants Trump to be more active against the bill making its way on Capitol Hill.  

Kushner needs MBS' rubber stamp on his "peace deal", his cooperation in the war against Iran, and whatever else they have cooked up.       ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Kelly told his staff and media present that he fired Tillerson when he was on the toilet due to a stomach virus. He deserved the same treatment. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "I didn't think the leopards would eat *my* face!" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well, General, as I learned in the Marine Corps if you play stupid games you win stupid prizes. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I don't really care if or why John Kelly is furious. I mean he's a piece of shit. However, there are many reasons why Americans should generally be pissed off at Kushner and Ivanka. They should not be involved in our gov at all but daddy won an election with the help of Russia so now they make decisions and take actions on behalf of America. Wtf  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ A racist incompetent asshole is angry at a more powerful racist, incompetent asshole. Nice ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Fuck John Kelly - he bought into the corruption... hopefully he goes down with the ship. ~end~

Many, over ten, such as Sean Hannity, Steve Doocey, Brian Kilmeade, Jeanine Pirro, Tuckface Carlson, Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, Greg Gutfeld, Laura Ingraham, Tomi Lahren and even Geraldo Rivera are all currently tripping over each other! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ya know what?  I do not give a shit that any of these assholes are upset.  The white house has been turned into a fucking reality show and the media isn't helping with articles like this.  Kelly's out.  Who gives a shit that the racist fucker is mad? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No surprise that Ayers is nopeing out out of the white house  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well,  John,   I'm sure it would help ease some of that ire if you were to ... y'know ... stop by Mr. Mueller's office first thing.

I mean that's if you haven't been talking to him all this time. 

I mean I wouldn't want to make the "president" all paranoid and such.     

I mean it's not like someone has been wearing a wire all this time   right?

John?

You still there,  John?  

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You knew what you signed up for you traitor. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I don't really care, do u? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I hope they all lose this fight.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I don't see why. In Bob Woodward's book he said this was the worst job he'd ever had in his life. Seems like he would be happy to be gone. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Yes John, let the hate flow through you!

Please, tell us how you *really* feel! ~end~

  ~cmt~ >Bloomberg News recently reported that Trump had named Mark Meadows, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, as a possible replacement, with Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, budget director Mick Mulvaney and U.S. 

This might be worth it to get Meadows out of the House.  Choosing Whitaker though would just be another shot to the foot.  Not sure one way or the other about Mulvaney in the role though. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Crocodile tears. 

I frankly don't give a flying fuck. 

John KNEW what he was getting into. He knew what these people are and how they would operate. 

Anyone that acts shocked at the behavior of these animals is either really fucking stupid or was in on it and is attempting to save face.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well this is either Act 3 & the part of the story where we see all the people abandoning ship right before the total collapse of the administration OR this is Act 2 & the part of the story where because of everyone abandoning ship POTUS is pushed over the edge to bring about the end of all humanity.

&#x200B;

The suspense over which narrative we are in is terrifying.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Let them fight. /Dr.Serizawa

&#x200B; ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ IF this is true I expect that Kelly will start to make comments both on and off the record, similar to what Tillerson did, in the coming months as the GOP start to abandon Trump. 

That is a big IF though. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Isn’t anyone else furious that they even have security clearances? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ palace intrigue, what a concept ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He's going to be really pissed then when Donny starts insulting & blaming him for all his fuck-ups next year. ~end~

I mean, other than being old enough to remember that show... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I mean, what the fuck did you expect was gonna happen, John? Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. You knew what you were getting into when you took the job. Asshat. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Does _no one_ hold Trump accountable for the running of the White House?  Even his own Chief of Staff blames others for what is ultimately Trump's responsibility.

WTF?  How dysfunctional does the Trump admin have to be that a fucking four-star Marine general is brainwashed into believing that his Commander in Chief _isn't_ where the buck stops?  Talk about gaslighting... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The information this disgruntled former employee has could be devastating...

Not a good tactic to piss off someone who has intimate knowledge of your crimes. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ *"Blow jobs over Bro jobs."* -Trump, probably. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ “Kelly purposely steps on pile of shit, is furious when his shoe smells like shit.” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Oh please, Mr.^1 Kelly. You were the holder of an empty title; everyone and their dog knows that you and the Mango Mussolini aren't even on *speaking* terms. Everyone knows that - to the extent either of you ever achieves anything - it's by working *around* each other.

That's not a tenable situation for a Chief of Staff - you should know that after your many years in the Army! And when the CO and his CoS can't tolerate each others' presence...it's rarely the CO who gets reassigned. So you were going to get the heave-ho regardless of any other factors, and sooner rather than later.

Don't make yourself appear even smaller than you are - just go quietly and don't make a spectacle.

***

^1 Yes, I know Kelly is a General, and should properly be titled "Gen. Kelly". However, given his shameless abuse of his own military service and his son's sacrifice to advance blatantly political and self-serving ends, I refuse to use that honorific to address him. Deal with it - or don't. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He knew what he signed up for ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I would love it if John Kelly spilled all of the beans to Mueller, it would really get things rocking in the next few weeks. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why are Jared and Ivanka allowed a say on who to fire/hire?

Fuck those shit gremlins. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Wow this is how the United States is run. The fools who call themselves republicans and support this administration must not have known the level of dignity and respect that office used to have.  ~end~

  ~cmt~ A list of things he will do about it:

&#x200B; ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Come on..  At this point I doubt very seriously that anything happening in the white house would take Kelly by surprise or make him furious.  It would be like standing in a shit storm and worrying about sullying your lapels.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Shouldn't he be grateful to get out of that shit hole? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Will he finally grow some genitalia and speak out about the clusterfuck he oversaw? ~end~

I'm expecting some long and deeply tragic poetry on Tumblr any moment now.

Go after her Mueller. Don Jr. is a son he could lose.  ~end~

  ~cmt~ Good. He’s a horrible person and deserves more. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Want revenge, Kelly? I'm sure you have some interesting things to tell.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He played with fire and got pissed at it for burning him. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ivanka or Jared will be the next Chief of Staff. I have no doubt about it and I’ve been waiting for this to happen since that sham of an election. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I fully expect him to make Ivanka the next Chief of Staff. ~end~

That sounds very shady. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why would he even want the job  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well, instead of looking to the Founding Fathers, he should have looked to other tinpot, family run, banana republic dictators for lessons on how to run the office of the president.   ~end~

cry me a fucking river Kelly ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The echo chamber says that Kelly wanted out. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Can we stop throwing the word coup around, cuz I fully expect there to actually be an attempt in the not so distant future, and I'm afraid by then the word will be meaningless, like everything else kthx. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Please, tell us what you really feel ... with Mueller on the other side of the table ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ well I sure hope he FLIPS on them, and maybe their little hands dad, too! ~end~

  ~cmt~ So who will he hire from Fox News this time for the position? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump on reporting that he had no Plan B after Ayers declined to serve as Chief if Staff >> "Why wouldn't someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in Washington?" 

Umm, because your Whitehouse is cross between a dumpster fire and an exploding whale carcass? 

The world will be amazed to see what desperate lunatic takes the role.

Don’t be surprised if his daughter or son-in-law get the call-up. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ John Kelly is a confused and miserable piece of shit that had all the respect he deserved until he joined the administration, he could have been remembered a decent person, a hardened soldier, and respectable member of the intelligence/military community and now he's a joke, all of his own doing.  Fuck him. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ | "Many, over ten, are vying for and wanting the White House Chief of Staff position," Trump tweeted.

At least the nation’s infants have some sense. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The best thing that is coming out of this administration is the drama of them all shooting each other.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Huh.

IIRC, one of the rumors why Ayers wouldn’t take the job is because Ivanka didn’t like him.  Wonder what the truth is. ~end~

  ~cmt~ The President's argument

>One person familiar with the meeting told Business Insider that the president argued the USMCA will bring so much money into the US that it would be almost as if Mexico paid for the wall.

The Democrats rebuttal

>'You're going to take the money we made from the trade agreement. Well that's an opportunity cost, Mr. President, for American workers and our economy that's supposed to benefit from that. They did not know you are passing a bill so that you could pay for a wall and say Mexico paid for it with our profits from our workers and our businesses and the rest,'" Pelosi said

TL;DR: Trump says the new USMCA trade deal will bring in so much money, we will be able to pay for a wall.  The Dems say that's not Mexico, but the American taxpayers, paying for the wall ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > One person familiar with the meeting told Business Insider that the president argued the USMCA will bring so much money into the US that it would be almost as if Mexico paid for the wall.

  ~cmt~ Does he *still* think Mexico is going to pay for his stupid wall?  He's fucking delusional.  And it wouldn't even surprise me if he didn't read the trade agreement at all and just assumed it was in there. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I read part of the transcript. All I see if Trump making the same point over and over but never getting what Pelosi and Schumer are trying to say.   
Trump just keeps saying we  (The GOP) don't have the votes in the Senate to pass border funding right now so why even try.  Pelosi and Schumer are trying to say "Work with us to make a compromise" but Trump just keep bleating about how they won't give in to his demands and he's going to shut down if they don't.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pelosi should just introduce the "Mexico Will Pay for the Wall" act which completely authorizes the complete construction of the border wall, but ONLY with funds from an account funded EXCLUSIVELY by the Mexican government.  Make the obtuse old fucker make good on his campaign promise to his voters.    They'll turn on him when he can't do it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It’s funny, the people who support Trump’s made up 95/96% figures in reduction of illegal immigrants are the same folk who claim it’s impossible to know how many illegal immigrants sneak into the US. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So that's why Schumer is holding back his laughter. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > Pelosi also seemed to note that spending these revenues on a border wall, as opposed to some other government program, would represent **a opportunity** cost.

Literally unreadable. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump has grown up on a "Say anything to make the deal go thru then never give anyone what you promised" lifestyle, sadly that doesn't really work here, well, it COULD but he's not very good at doing it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ it is explicable, he's an idiot. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If that's the case why asking for 5bil? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yeah, I don't think that Mexico is onboard with that anymore than they were 2 years ago. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ [Enjoy this glorious slice of fried gold.](https://youtu.be/iYZKrn7Bbl8) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Mexico will not pay one penny of the wall ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hahaha!  April Fool! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So there’s no reason to shut down the government because it won’t fund the wall? Kewl.  ~end~

  ~cmt~  "The firm has already been paid $13.6 million. But when the inspector  general audited the company’s actions, it discovered that as of Oct. 1 —  more than 10 months into the contract — Accenture had successfully  processed only two accepted job offers. In addition, it did so largely  using CPB resources instead of its own, the report said. "

Trump admin is anything but fiscally conservative. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ 7 million dollar men. Very cool, very legal. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > CBP officials argued with the inspector general’s conclusion, insisting that not only did Accenture recruit two agents, but it set up a hiring process and helped move “thousands” of applicants into the pipeline for consideration. The Office of the Inspector General responded that no records tracking these applicants exist, and therefore “we question the veracity” of CBP’s argument.

So what did they use 13.6 million dollars for ?  Last time I worked a gov't contract you had to provide a detail of how the money was used (billable hours, materials, office space, etc).   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Just more money laundering. No big deal. GOP voters are completely OK with this type of thievery. If you think I'm joking, just look at the criminals they keep electing and ask yourself where your tax break is at. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Just some facts from this situation, because it's pretty strange. 

Accenture is owned by a French guy and headquartered in the tax haven of Dublin, Ireland. Trump admin (CBP specifically) granted a $297M 5-year contract to a foreign firm rather than an American one. ($13.6M was just the first payment)

CBP never established oversight or performance metrics. Basically, they issued a half-decade contract worth a third of a billion dollars, without any way to check if they delivered. That's weird to say the least.

Accenture issued no reports or progress updates. That's also weird, it's almost like they didn't expect any oversight.

Accenture staff isn't on board, they're protesting and petitioning to drop the contract: [https://gizmodo.com/accenture-employees-demand-their-company-break-ties-wit-1830474961](https://gizmodo.com/accenture-employees-demand-their-company-break-ties-wit-1830474961), so it's possible internal sabotage is occurring.

Contract is for 1,600 less agents than needed, which is weird. Why not issue it for what is needed?

Contract, if delivered as promised, would result in a $40,000 cost, per hire. That's 4-6x the industry standard. Never explained why they're willing to pay so much more than any other contractor would charge. 

CPB has a dedicated Office of Human Resources Management that does nothing but recruit and hire. They never explained why they needed to give a third of a billion to an outside contractor to do that job for them. 

This whole thing looks fishy. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Accenture? Why does this not surprise me in the least? Same company that lost Copenhagen (iirc) a bunch of money by fucking up the pay system. Same company that's basically the most hated and least quality IT outsource in the world. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Guys, he meant swamp the drain, not drain the swamp. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ “The private sector is more efficient than the public.” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Incase anyone is wondering (I was), that would amount to 1,931,034.5 man hours at federal minimum wage. Or 241,379 8 hour work days. That’s 48,275 forty hour weeks, 930 years. That’s enough to pay 23 people minimum wage every week from the age of 18 until they’re 60 years old. 

After taxes that would be about $250 a week. If they only have to cover their personal expenses (Food, gas, bills), they should be able to make it on about $150 a week living modestly. If they save $100 a week for that entire time they’ll have about $215,000 before interest when(if) they retire at 60. That would give these 23 people just under $5 Million between them. 

For context, our annual defense budget is about 362,500 times as much as this single matter. So the defense budget could provide the same circumstances for say around, 8,340,000 Americans. If those 8 million Americans saved the same $100 a week it would equate to approximately 1.8 Trillion dollars. So that’s 11.7% of the entire debt for the country, held by about 2.4% of the population. Distribution of wealth man. 

Obviously a lot of this is assumed and theoretical, and it wouldn’t work like that by a long shot, but still, we have the ability to give everyone a good life without sacrificing our infrastructure. We really need to start figuring out better ways to use our money, whether it’s health coverage, UBI, housing grants, or something. But we have to figure out a way to do it without bringing in corporations on contracts that they can further exploit, and *continue* to slowly rob wealth from the masses.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >One of the recommendations involves determining if Accenture should reimburse the Department of Homeland Security for services not delivered.

You damn right they should reimburse the DHS. Curious who owns or has stocks in this company... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Apparently the best people don't come cheap ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Professional recruiter here, I've been doing this for 5 years.  

The average fee for that firm, if they placed all 7500 folks, would be $39,600.  Absurd.  Average fees should be near 10-12K for these types of positions.

Their performance should *not* be in question, however.  This is a dogshit administration and a terrible, terrible branch of government to work for.  Literally *no one* wants to do that job.  

Surprise, surprise Trump.  No one wants to shovel your shit, and the people that say they want "their jobs" actually don't.  Especially not these shit jobs. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Reads headline. Says to self, jeez, I bet that’s Accenture. Reads article. Yep, sure is.

They’ve been up to shady shit since the Arthur Anderson/ Enron days and I don’t care if Accenture split from Anderson prior to the whole Enron scandal, tainted meat is tainted meat. Doesn’t matter how you butcher the cow.

Source: cousin worked for Accenture for about fifteen years and the amount of bloated government contracts they get is astounding. ~end~

  ~cmt~ It can’t be that hard to find a racist bully prick to patrol the border.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I guess since Trump was aghast that his highest officials only made ~$200,000, you could see why he paid two people so much. He doesn't know that $200k is a lot of money to most people.

  ~cmt~ This should be two different sentences:     The Trump Administration paid Accenture nearly $14 million.         Accenture found them 2 new employees.   It is obvious that one has little to do with the other, even though they should.   ~end~

  ~cmt~ I wonder what Trump actually paid them for. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Follow the money and you will find one of trumps cronies ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Honestly, this isn't a Trump problem this is a problem with the advisor class that exists in Washington DC. The company [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/afs-industry-index), when looking at their website it becomes apparent that despite throwing around buzzwords they don't actually DO anything. They seem to "advise on projects" which in practice just means lobbying agencies and lawmakers to hire them to then connect with other contractors that actually can perform the job. Which is a necessary task, but is why we have administrations in the first place. The problem here is when Accenture figured that they could cut out the DO side on this recruiting task in order to take all of this overpriced government contract, but when faced with the task of actually DOING SOMETHING, they failed to do so because that is fundamentally not what their organization is. Although I do not doubt that there was a lot of work put in by a marketing intern of buzzwordy powerpoints in a google drive somewhere. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Kleptocracy ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ People who own millions should not be in charge of million of dollars. They have no concept of what things actually cost and what’s normal. Like $30,000 for office furniture. 

Rich conservative men cannot possibly be fiscally conservative  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The Congress needs to investigate this. This needs to be a bipartisan issue.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Imagine being one of those two reading this. “$14 million to recruit me and Steve?!? And all we got were these border patrol beer koozies as a signing bonus!” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is why Trump keeps going on about building a wall.  It has nothing to do with improving border security, and everything to do with lining the pockets of companies that would get the contracts.  

It’s more filling the swamp with corporate socialism at the expense of the many.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ $7 mil each?  Shit, id join border patrol for $7 mil  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ “They’re spending nearly $40,000 per hire!”

Sounds like a bargain when the contract was awarded.

One of the ways the federal govt gets states, schools and even private companies to kowtow to them is by threatening to bar them from govt contracting/funding.

  ~cmt~ Accenture, formerly Arthur Anderson, a company brought down by the Enron scandal and current special prosecutor Robert Mueller. Overall they were paid 247 million on this contract. The irony is when Trumped announced the issues at the border armed militia grabbed their weapons and went to the patrol the border, on their dime. Accenture can't find people to get paid to do the work? Sounds like the government is paying Arthur Anderson back. 

Also after the Enron fiasco and the ripple effect on the US economy they decided it would be best to domicile the rebranded company in Dublin, you know where they don't have to pay US taxes.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I have no idea why people keep paying Accenture. For the price of a medium business jet you get two junior B-school grads, asking as if from a pull string, “what else can we do to move the needle?” and realize they just keep saying that until you do the actual work. ~end~

That's just smart business right there.

  ~cmt~ They hit this in the article, but I want to hit it again: a large chunk of the Greek debt crisis was widespread tax cheating. If that happens there will be massive damage that will be very difficult to undo. 

The only people who benefit from an underfunded IRS are tax frauds. The freeloaders who want to reap the benefits of living in America without contributing.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >Without enough staff, the IRS has slashed even basic functions. It has drastically pulled back from pursuing people who don’t bother filing their tax returns. New investigations of “nonfilers,” as they’re called, dropped from 2.4 million in 2011 to 362,000 last year. According to the inspector general for the IRS, the reduction results in at least $3 billion in lost revenue each year. Meanwhile, collections from people who do file but don’t pay have plummeted. Tax obligations expire after 10 years if the IRS doesn’t pursue them. Such expirations were relatively infrequent before the budget cuts began. In 2010, $482 million in tax debts lapsed. By 2017, according to internal IRS collection reports, that figure had risen to $8.3 billion, 17 times as much as in 2010. The IRS’s ability to investigate criminals has atrophied as well.

Basically, rich people will stop (or have already?) paying taxes and there will be no consequences for them other than the nation's declining institutions and infrastructure. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is a good article and worth the read. It discusses the ever shrinking IRS budget and how that impacts the number of staff available to audit taxpayers.

We are on the honor system when it comes to taxes in a lot of ways as there's plenty of income and deduction items that don't get reported to the IRS on any forms and it is up to the taxpayer to substantiate those items with documentation IF they are audited.

There are far fewer audits now than there were just a decade ago, but that doesn't impact the average taxpayer as their tax situations are relatively straight-forward with very little room for exploiting the system since most of their income and deductions would be reported to the IRS (W-2 income, mortgage interest, etc.).

The fewer audits allow those with higher incomes and more complex tax situations exploit the system and push the envelope.

We talk about the wealthy buying off our government and pushing through tax cuts, but one has to wonder if they also push for the budget of the IRS to be gutted so that they can get away with even more on the taxes they actually do pay. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ But the glorious job creators! We must give them all the money so that they may... make jobs? Oh wait. Only demand for goods and services creates jobs. So why are they treated like royalty again?
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What makes it so asinine is that they built their success on the backs of taxpayers. The roads used to transport their goods, the public schools to educate their employees, the corporate welfare..And then they turn around and hoard their cash offshore.

Something is wrong with the social contract.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That's what brought down Rome. Well, that and a weak senate and a leader in danger of prosecution...  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This needs to be the next progressive campaign message. Taxes are great! They pay for roads, and hospitals, and our society. The problem is that the rich aren't paying their fair share, and that makes them 'smart'?

  ~cmt~ >On one side are anti-tax Republicans, while on the other are Democrats who fear publicly supporting the taxman

This is a big problem. Democrats have to figure out a way to become the pro-tax party in a positive sense. That way when Republicans float tax cuts it will only hurt them. ~end~

  ~cmt~ I think this behavior is missed in economics: We think that additional wealth has deminishing marginal utility. We also think that people are rational and want to maximize wealth, consume and end up at some terminal wealth (the first example I learned was cake eating where the terminal wealth was zero, no more cake). Where I think the disconnect is, that some people the terminal wealth has a lot of utility so they only focus on wealth maximization thru any means.

  ~cmt~ That's fine. You can pay the rich person's taxes so the government can spend it supporting the rich person's business. In the end, the rich person will cut your paycheck so that they can 'afford to invest in the business' which really means giving themselves a big bonus. Just pay extra taxes from then on to cover the difference so the rich person can have a business to sort of semi-pay you after they're done partying with the taxpayer's money. ~end~

But along with that there needs to be a significant simplification of the tax code, to make it much more easily managed and more simple to enforce tax payments.  While there has been a lot of talk about simplifying the tax code the US congress seems not to be able to get the job done. Just one more check off on the list of the ways congress has failed the American people.  ~end~

They have unlimited money and resources (that are paid for by taxpayers) and you have far less.  This is fine with me.... IF they were honest.

After about a year of insanity, hundreds of pages of documentation, we insisted on Arbitration and that ended the cruel game they were playing.  I later learned that the "game" is why they have so much agent turn-over; honest people cannot work for them for long. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yep, many of them put their money in "charities" or LLP's and put their other family members on the "board".  Then they hold "board meetings" while on vacation and use the "charity money" while on vacation to go to out to eat and take "meeting minutes" afterwards.  They're just a bunch of crooks that have an inability to look in the mirror and realize they are the problem.  They continue to rail on minorities while at the same time having the balls to make statements  such as "after you buy a home your property taxes should never go up."  I honestly can't stand hanging out with my hypocrite family any longer.  The whole "charity" scam is why you see so many conservatives who want church or charity to take care of america's homeless and healthcare problems.  Less scrutiny on their scams.  ~end~

  ~cmt~ Did Trump say he was smart for not paying his taxes? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >The cuts are depleting the staff members who help ensure that taxpayers pay what they owe. As of last year, the IRS had 9,510 auditors. That’s down a third from 2010. The last time the IRS had fewer than 10,000 revenue agents was 1953, when the economy was a seventh of its current size. And the IRS is still shrinking. Almost a third of its remaining employees will be eligible to retire in the next year, and with morale plummeting, many of them will.

Even accounting for the rapid advances in IT, this is a stark figure to grasp.

Further, you can't automate away everything.  Complex financial webs (often purposefully designed to be deceitful) don't lend themselves to programmatic evaluation.  It takes a human mind, flexible and intuitive, to pick that stuff apart.

What I imagine is happening is that the IRS is purposefully being knee-capped.

Imagine:  Your task is to lobby Congress, to convince them to write bills that command the IRS to automate everything in the name of "governmental efficiency", full well knowing that:

1. Much of the software will be created by privately owned contractors, making their inner workings a secret - thus what they do or do not catch and how they catch it, is a trade secret.  Well connected people can ensure that this works to their advantage, by keeping them below the radar.
2. Of course when automating, it makes sense to apply the most time to dealing with the most common use cases.  The most common thing to audit is going to be your average working class tax return.  Thus, we see the focus of advancements in auditing tech, shift away from those well-connected and well-off.

There was a podcast that I listed to some time back, about how in the modern world, many professionals who deal with high case loads, rely on algorithms to do some of the work for them.  For example, a judge may rely on an algorithm to approximate an guilty offender's likelihood of recidivism (to break the law again), to determine their sentencing.  Note:  This actually happens.

The judge inputs the offender's name and their crime into a computer, and the program and algorithm scan all these public knowledge databases to spit out some number - a prison sentence length based off of a scientific algorithm, using all the knowledge we have at our disposal.

This is more fair, right?  We've removed the bias of the judge, and we're using the best information we have available.  It's been standardized!

Problem is, it often isn't fair.  That program an algorithm was made by a private company, and that algorithm is a trade secret.  Even if it isn't explicitly biased, it might accidentally be.

We've only taken the source of bias from a judge (whom writes a decision which can be reviewed by an appeals court or the public at large) and shifted that bias into a black box, where that decision process is made in secret.

Holy shit, rambling.

Long story short - automating shit doesn't always work out so well, especially in the enforcement of laws. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ wow how primitive article - blaming the IRS budget for everything, instead:

there are tax loopholes - for example the real estate tax laws that have enabled Jared Kushner not to pay taxes the last 5 years,

there are "charity deductions" that are borderline tax avoidance schemes - see Zuckerberg charity corporation for exaple

then there is the use of offshore companies and tax heavens that should be made illegal or be limited

then there are the banking secrets - like they use in Switzerland that make it difficult to control the global money flows,

then there are the banking crimes - Iceland put 26 bankers in jail during the 2008 global financial crisis but almost nobody went to jail in the USA, given how small country Iceland is - the equivalent would have been hundreds of American bankers in jail during the last crisis

Once, after I called into his office once to complain (politely) about his hypocrisy and double standards, he had the gall to send me a letter in the mail preaching to me about the importance of *being civil*.  

He is the living embodiment of hypocrisy and self-righteousness - exactly the kind of behavior Jesus repeatedly condemned. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Another lying hypocrite who contradicts what he said when Clinton was impeached ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ According to Wikipedia, Trump gave him the Presidential Medal of Freedom last month (November 16, 2018).

Maybe that has something to do with it? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Anyone want to bet Orrin received dark money from a super-pac who has ties to Russian money.... Anyone?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Verified human Orrin Hatch is very good at making smart human words and is definitely not a reptilian monster.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Remember when people said Mormons had morals?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Santorum said a similar thing on CNN the other day: “We elected him to break the law! This is what people wanted.” (Something like that). NOBODY on the panel even called him or addressed it. I just don’t get how these statements aren’t immediately met with disgust. At least make them defend such an asinine statement. But nothing.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is the 'Shrugged Shoulders' defense strategy that Republicans are starting to adopt and will adopt en masse in the coming months. They've tied themselves to Trump's anchor, and the only way to survive the next 23 months is to simply shrug their shoulders and carry on, banking on the fact that enough of their supporters won't care either, and will turn out to re-elect them. I think it's going to work. 

The machinations that the Founders put in place in order to deal with a criminal president aren't automatic. They are constituted of real people. People like Hatch and McConnell and Paul Ryan. People who are supposed to choose the rule of law over personal power. Our Founders were prepared for a Donald Trump, they were not prepared for the Republican Party of 2018.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ There you go Mormons of Utah.  You've sent a liar to senate for over 40 years.  A man who professes to be Christian while swearing an oath on the bible to uphold and defend the constitution while declaring "he doesn't care" if the president is a criminal.

&#x200B;

He puts his political party and personal wealth above an oath sworn on the bible and you elect him?  How very Christian of you. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ One more reason why term limits need to exist, dude is 84 and in another life he'd be one of those rambling boomers on Facebook sharing Obummer memes. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Boy, how Hatch's opinions on this topic changed. Here's him voting to impeach Clinton:

>"Indeed, to the dismay of some, I had expressed a hope and a desire early on in this constitutional drama that the President would acknowledge his untruthful statements. He chose to do otherwise and perpetuated his untruthfulness. Although some believe this is solely a private matter, I believe this is really about the President's fidelity to the oath of office and the rule of law.  
>  
>Committing crimes of moral turpitude such as perjury and obstruction of justice go to the heart of qualification for public office. These offenses were committed by the chief executive of our country, the individual who swore to faithfully execute the laws of the United States.   
>  
>This great nation can tolerate a President who makes mistakes. But it cannot tolerate one who makes a mistake and then breaks the law to cover it up. Any other citizen would be prosecuted for these crimes.   
>  
>To those of us who have ourselves taken an oath to uphold the Constitution -- which represents the rule of law and not of men -- it should not matter how brilliant or popular we perceive the President to be. The Constitution is how we govern based on the principle of equality and not emotion. The Constitution is what guides us as a nation of laws and not personalities. The Constitution is what enables us to live in freedom.   
>  
>I will vote for conviction on both articles of impeachment -- not because I want to -- but because I must. Upholding our Constitution -- a sacred document that Americans have fought and died for -- is more important than any one person, including the President of the United States.”

  ~cmt~ Un-indicted Co-conspirator 2? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And to think that way back when people thought he might be one of the *sane* Republicans who'd step up... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter, unless I'm Orrin Hatch: So help me God." - Orrin Hatch ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ DGAF isn't exactly a strategy... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hatch is absolutely one of the hypocritical idiots who has ever been in Washington which takes some doing. As he rides off into retirement I hope everything he’s done is exposed and he’s never mentioned positively again. What an abject failure as a lawmaker.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Not just embarrassingly bad, but morally treasonous.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Orrin Hatch is so accustomed to compromising his values he has none left.  His leaving the Senate is warmly welcomed by all. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Treason ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ from the article:
>A wise man once said this: "This great nation can tolerate a President who makes mistakes. But it cannot tolerate one who makes a mistake and then breaks the law to cover it up." 

The quote was Hatch justifying the impeachment of Clinton. That caught my attention.  By what standard is hatch eligible for the 'wise' label?  Because he's rich, white, old? no one else qualifies? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Orrin Hatch's little dismissive hand wave of the Kavanaugh protestors embodies exactly how much he respects any American that isn't wealthy or powerful.

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ When someone’s professional responsibilities include giving a fuck about the commission of felonies, and he obstinately refuses to do so in specific cases because it serves a personal agenda, at what point does that itself become abetting said felonies and exposure to an obstruction charge? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ In the news: 80-year old rich white man doesn't give a shit about anyone else. 

News at 11... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "As long as I'm getting mine, fuck you!"

Basically. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Orrin is certainly one of the most unhinged and deranged of the GOP hypocrites. He will not be missed.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why not just come out and say you'll always give a republican a pass?


Not a single Republican voter would be bothered by that. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The Rudolph Hess of America. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Hatch has just laid another bad egg. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Only the good die young they say. 

Which explains why this Racist artifact is still on the earth.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ugh hatch just makes my fucking blood boil  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What a shit poor way for him to retire out! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "I think we ought to get to where we support our Presidents when they're right and quit trying to destroy them just for political reasons" unless they're democrats.. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Orrin Hatch needs to die. That congressional medal is a joke. Hatch is an old man with old ideas...and he supports/defends a known traitor. Fuck him. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Orrin “yes, there are polygamist child rape culture and public welfare abuse in my state, but whatabout the Democrats not believing in Scientology, which is oppressing my right to my religious freedom” Hatch.

Terrible, terrible human being  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > Orrin Hatch's embarrassingly bad defense 

Can't be embarrassed if you've got no shame.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Keep making Utah proud, you ventriloquist side show.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I dont think Hatch even remembers who is President.  He is too busy looking for his invisible glasses.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ At least he is honest. I do not care what Trump does as long as he helps my agenda. Crimes, immorality hypocrisy all do not matter as long as we win. At least we know who Hatch really is. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He is way past his retirement date.  That fucker needs to go home and lay in his bed of embarrassment.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So if I was a reporter I would ask the same question and then follow up his answer with  a couple of cops swinging cuffs, like some old cop drama, and say” well did you know covering for a traitor is treason” just to see his face.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He doesn't care.  He's too old to sugarcoat it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Defense?"  That's as much a defense as "I guess" is a vow. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What it costs to sell you're soul and all that you are. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So this is the Gouge Other People party defending Donald Trump? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Every Republican is an abyss ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The resignation in the lack of a coherent defense is sad on many levels. A US Senator who has thrown in the towel two years early into his retirement.

He got a prestigious medal from a crook and traded that for his duty to the Constitution. Might as well have been 22 pieces of silver. Good riddance, Mr Hatch, may your quotes live on as a testament to hypocracy and weakness. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is why we need term limits and age limits for politicians. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The rest of the right wing should stop bullshitting and admit that this is what they all believe ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What did anyone expect from the guy who "saved" Morton Thiokol after they killed the Challenger astronauts? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He's old and senile and the people of Utah don't care. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The Republican Party ladies and gentlemen. 

Both parties are NOT the same.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That sentence is too long. "Orrin Hatch's embarrassingly bad" would suffice. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Demonstrably true. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This all started with Gingrich in the House. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Newt Gingrich and Mitch McConnel have caused more lasting and pervasive damage to this country than any other person(s) I can possibly think of.

You might be able to argue about Roger Stone and other media heads, but really, those Newt and Mitch were the ones that enacted and facilitated the kinds of terrible policy to the detriment of the country.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The present administration didn't walk in by itself.  There's a sizable portion of the American electorate which bears the ultimate responsibility for this. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ She's still a republican and I still disagree with a lot of her positions, but at least she can see outright corruption and call it for what it is. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Time for these shitbuckets to get on the right side of history. It's too late for McConnell and his ilk to grow balls they've already shown they don't have. They must abandon Trump NOW before it's too late to save their own asses.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This might offend some people, and I’m sorry ahead of time. 

Each state should have a number of Senators dependent on their population size. There is absolutely no logic behind the Dakotas having twice as many Senators as California. Their population size combined is like a fifth of Los Angeles’ alone. It is absolutely ridiculous and completely contrary to how a Democracy should work.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yes. This!!!! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And it was true even before Trump ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It still shocks me that the "religious right" chooses to identify with these unscrupulous, underhanded, downright evil thugs! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I blame [James Comey.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-comey-letter-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ flies are drawn to shit so it only makes sense they’d all gather around the biggest steaming pile of shit they’ve ever seen ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This guy looks like David California  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ These men are cowards, Jennie. 
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I wonder if Jennifer Rubin was saying this  during the Bush Jr. years (I know the answer)?  Glad she's seen a little bit of the light, lets see if she rubber bands back to her previous state as soon as a Democratic President is sitting in the white house. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ *again. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What about Congress, and the portion of population that blindly vote for ‘their party’ no mater how ethically lost it is. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Is trump forcing Americans to pay for services they dont want? Is trump starting wars that will destroy multiple countries like the war in iraq?

Is trump promoting eugenics and selecting who gets to breed?


Is trump drafting kids to go fight illegal wars?

Then no, trump isnt the most unethical or incompetent president.

  ~cmt~ Did he do that before or after the Democratic Rep. told him if he behaved better, his search results would look more positive?

I'm betting after... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's worrisome how much being a "Liberal" makes us second class citizens in so many people's eyes. Trump just tweeted that Comey is a Democrat, and thus never should have been in charge of the FBI, as if it is a disqualifying trait. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >**McCarthyism,** name given to the period of time in American history that saw Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy produce a series of investigations and hearings during the 1950s in an effort to expose supposed communist infiltration of various areas of the U.S. government. The term has since become a byname for defamation of character or reputation by means of widely publicized indiscriminate allegations, especially on the basis of unsubstantiated charges. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Holy shit, dude just request the actual CODE of the search ranking algorithm. Learn how to read computer language, and decipher what the fuck the algorithm does with the 200+ signals it analyzes to come up with a rank you stupid fuck.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'll bet his picture shows up for the search  "racist prick".

Edit: His picture is all over the place in response to"Racist Congressman". ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why should that be King's business? 

Are we to assume that if they happened to be, it would mean necessarily that they "rig" Google?

Fuck conservatives with their fucking persecution delusion. And most of all, fuck Steve King. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And then what?  Get them fired?  Send them to re-education camps?  

&#x200B;

In King's pathetic little mind, burning at the stake is probably the way to go. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Actual McCarthyism. Basically anyone left-of-centre = Communists. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Are you now or have you ever been ~~a member of the Communist party~~ a Democrat? " ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Does Steve King nazi what he sounds like? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Under what legal authority would King try and force this request?  I really want to see the google response to the request.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This ish is hilarious. Not quite as bad as trying to ensure no Democrats work for the FBI, but almost.  ....Like federal law enforcement is a bastion of progressives

This is dumb AF for a different reason. Liberals already outnumber conservatives, particularly when you are talking about anyone with more than a BA. 

Besides, if you smoke out everyone that thinks Trump is an idiot, aren't you left with everyone that is biased FOR Trump/conservatives?!

Get the fk out of here with that BS ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The nazi wants what? A list of names? Google should report him to the FBI. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Steve King is a traitor to American values ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Steve King is a Nazi. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I assume he was told to fuck off? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "All we want is a list of private citizens who work for you, and access to see their social media accounts. And then, based on their social media preferences, we'll then need to be able to tell easily offline whether or not they have a liberal bias. I know! Maybe we'll make them sew a patch on their clothing or something. Something distinctive, like, I don't know, a star." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The nazi machine is alive and well in the REPUBLICAN party. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What is this, Nazi Germany? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Nazis gonna nazi. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Nazi congressman lol ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Does he really mean Jews?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What the actual fuck.

"I disagree with your politics, so I have the right to crawl up your ass and inspect it. Oh, but I'm a Republican, so keep the government out of things."

Steve King gives the *president and Turtle McTurtle-face a sporting run for biggest asshole in our government. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ King likely asked for pointers from Computer Expert Extraordinaire Rudy Giuliani. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No problem Rep. King.  Our primary coder is Mr. Seymour Buttz.   He is assisted by Mr. Michael Hunt and Peter Ian Staker. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is a joke.  This guy is a joke. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ JFC, why not propose they wear badges while you're at it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm surprised that Iowa racist didn't ask for black employee names ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ King has 30 minutes between The Wheel and Matlock reruns.  He needs to fill that time with something - so hunting down liberals for their supposed bias against him will fit the bill ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Demonizing the majority party and demographic may work well for you with what few donors in bumfuck Iowa you have left, King, but it's not going to get you any good headlines in the national press. Probably also not a good idea to do such a thing less than a month before your party becomes the minority in the chamber, idiot. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ so, a witch hunt then? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Joe McCarthy back from the dead? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Of course they're liberal! they aren't a bunch of mouth-breathing idiots!" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Representative Steve King of Iowa.  Nazi, Swastika, Confederate, racist, fascist. Carry on Google. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ People who vote for Congressmen like Steve King are the biggest fucking idiots on this planet.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If I were in that seat my response would have gone something like this:  
Employees at Google are welcome to have any political leanings they desire, just like your allowed to be openly racist.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He wants to know their names so he can leak them to his terrorist friends. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >	Rep. ~~Steve King~~ Joseph Goebells Asks Google CEO Sundar Pichai for Names of Employees to See If They’re ~~Liberals~~ Jews.

Fascists gonna fascist.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why is this even an issue?  

Didn't *Citizens United* make it OK for a any corporation to throw its weight behind its political views?

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The correct response to this is:  


"Senator McCarthy...excuse me, I mean Steve King, we will not be handing that information over."  


Then just sit there and stare him in the eyes. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Holy motherfucking 1st Amendment violation. This anti-American scumbag needs to be taken out of office.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Right after he names all of his Klan Members to see if they donate to David Duke ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Joseph McCarthy (current residence: Hell) must be very proud. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Steve King is an idiot ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Iowa - get your act together.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Did this behavior work in the 50s?  Its shocking that it did.  That portion of that generation can't get massive strokes fast enough. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ WTF?  This is insane. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Maybe they could wear some patch on their arms like a star so we always know who they are. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is the dude that's literally the poster boy for Neo-Nazis in government, right?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'd like the names of the employees who decided to censor left wing alternative news sites from their search results. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You'd think a politician of any stripe would know how tone deaf this is..... and yet here we are and no one is surprised. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Fuck every single one of the people that votes for Steve King.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "nah". ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I am from Iowa (not from his district) and am ashamed that he is a part of this state. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "...but don't you dare call me a Nazi!!" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That would be unconstitutional, Steve.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What **exactly** is he implying happen if he found out that it was liberals? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If they are smart enough to work for Google, you should probably just assume they are liberals or at the most, left leaning centrists.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He wants them to name names? Can these guys nazi the image they're projecting? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So this racist clown wants to start a McCarthy era hunt for "liberals" who work at private companies. I'm sure his ignorant base will eat this fascism up. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Here's an idea ... have a national public registry of Trump supporters.

Then anyone who isn't on it can be presumed to be a liberal (ok, maybe a RINO).

This registry is gonna be a lot of fun after 2019. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Never too early to start fundraising against The D- Western Iowa Fascist. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Maybe the Repugnicans should get Fox to create a search engine with "fair and balanced" results. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Apparently the only people worth a tinker's damn are Conservatives.   Which is incredibly short sighted and frankly idiotic. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Everything is political these days.  Facts don't matter, only what party you belong to.  If Steve King were to be rushed to the hospital for a health problem, would he be asking the doctors if they were Liberals?    Seriously, does he look at everyone walking by his house and wonder if they are liberals spying on him?  Are we supposed to wear badges?  I guess he thought everyone would wear the proper hat depending on who you voted for. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It would be awesome if he were given "names" of employees like:  Heywood Jablomey, Kraven Moorehead, Jack Meoff and the classic, Mike Hunt. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Old man yells at cloud ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ grotesque !! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He is a stupid bitch! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Who would have thought this could happen to Steve King the Fucking Moron. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Where is the Tea Party? Again, WHERE IS THE TEA PARTY? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Did he just make an argument to release Trump's taxes? ~end~

  ~cmt~ I love his most recent tweet:

> Fake News has it purposely wrong. Many, over ten, are vying for and wanting the White House Chief of Staff position. Why wouldn’t someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in Washington. Please report news correctly. Thank you! 

'Over ten' people!  wow, he's super popular. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Any normal administration would have worked out a final deal with a successor before announcing the firing of the current COS.  Like, did they not bother to confirm that Ayers wanted the job before axing Kelly? What a bunch of buffoons. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'd be furious too. Dude's 36 and just turned down one of the most important/influential jobs in the world. In saner times, it's a position people spend their entire careers building up to. Now you have 28 year olds quitting top level positions to 'advance their careers'. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It makes me happy when the Orange Traitor gets so angry.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I hear the Baroness, Destro and Dr. Mindbender are in the running. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What cracks me up about Ayers is that he wants to go right back to his consulting and PAC work to help Trump get re-elected in 2020. 

Rightists really have deluded themselves into believing Trump is a good president for America. They give him credit for things like the economy, which is doing well but was doing well when he was sworn in. And things which aren't even real like "progress" with North Korea or "re-establishing" respect for the USA abroad (while everyone who isn't Russia or SA basically is laughing at us now).

Ayers is a guy who's actually had a front row seat to see what a moron Trump is. Think about this, the leader of the republican party and the broader American conservative political movement wants him to be his right hand man in one of the most historic presidential administrations... and Ayers doesn't want the job. 

It says a lot about what many of the people around Trump must think about him. Also says a lot about how frustratingly smug and delusional rightists are that they continue to insist in the infallibility of all their ideas even as they rally around an absolute dumbass of a leader. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Smocking hot under the collar about the whole thing.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "They're super real but all in Canada, though, so you haven't met them" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I bet he took to Twitter thinking Ayers was a done deal.  Now Kelly has a use-by date and there's no way Trump can walk it back, not after announcing it on Twitter of all things.

So he's fucked. No Kelly, Ayers said no, and his ego won't let him reverse a publicly tweeted course of action.

It's glorious. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Of course he's pissed.  He's a narcissist.  *Everything* reflects on him. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Walmart in CANADA currently has 15 people vying for the cashier job at the new store.

Only hires the best people..... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I've always said he has to be embarrassed (which is a tall order for someone who has no shame). This is SUPER embarrassing for him and I'm reveling in it.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You had to be a goddamn moron to jump on this ship two years ago let alone now. One of the guys from Pod Save America said it would be like applying for a job piloting the Hindenburg after the guy is already screaming about the humanity. Even if you're squeaky clean your legal exposure is still through the roof.

EDIT: And the title of today's podcast was "Hot Tub Crime Machine" which is pretty hilarious.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What's maybe not emphasized in all this is that Ayers chose to decline and leave the administration after reporters started poking around his business and asking tough questions.  How does a guy end up with a net worth estimated in the double digit millions at age 36 with a career in politics?  My guess is not by making the most moral or legal of choices.  He's probably the first of several shady, nefarious characters who are taking their plunder and leaving the ship before the inevitable crash. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He’s not accustomed to being told no.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Too good. This guy’s 36 years old and he’s like “nah, I’m good on that president’s chief of staff job”. It’s delicious how mad this makes Trump ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Poor Ayers. According to Trumps MO, now he’s going to corner Ayers, clumsily sexually assault him, threaten him, and tweet trash about him not being worthy. 

Because nobody turns down an offer from Donald Trump. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The impending release if the piss tape is probably a factor in why nobody is going to take that job ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Thats because Pence is planning a 2020 run ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why wouldn't he turn it down?  He'll probably be Chief of Staff to the President longer by sticking with Pence. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He really has no idea that the Attorney General is NOT his personal defense lawyer. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Maybe he could pardon the MAGA bomber or that very fine gentleman from Charlottesville and have one of them do it. They're loyal and have nothing to lose. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ When Trump says "over ten" he means in age.

There are a few 12 year olds that would gladly take the chief of staff position. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So let me get this straight, a 34 year old extremely conservative man turned down one of those most prestigious jobs in the federal government.  You know your administration is fucked when someone that young and aspiring turns down the offer. Hell even fucking Mark Meadows turned down the offer. Mark Meadows is one of the most conservative members of the House and chair of the freedom caucus.

Imagine what it must be like. Not only would you have to manage a bunch of incompetent idiots, a narcissistic man child of a president who doesn't care about the law, you would also have to hire an extremely expensive lawyer to cover your ass in all the investigations.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He'll take the job once Pence takes office. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ There is a good chance this job will be filled by a beautiful woman with no experience or qualifications to perform the job. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Does Trump know how to do *anything* the office entails? Why on Earth would he fire his COS on the *assumption* that someone else was on board?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Careful, Mr Presiden't, stress is rising blood pressure. Bigly bad for your heart. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I heard Trump has binders of applicants. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why? Many, over ten totally real people are vying for this job. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Some people still want to have a career after this is all over. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why would anybody want to get involved with the Trump admin?

I would be surprised if they could find a janitor for the White House right now. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Even a rat knows not to jump onto a sinking ship. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well he's going to be chief of staff to president pence, for as long as that lasts. why would he go down with the ship that's sinking the quickest? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Whoever gets the job is going to be a complete idiot, because only a complete idiot would work for Trump knowing that he will stab you in the back in the future.  It is a complete guarantee that the stabbing will occur, since he has done it for every other person to work for him to this point. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yea, after they wrote up that glowing bit about how great it was that he accepted the job...

No one who has any aspirations of a real job after Trump is going to jump on this flaming band wagon as it goes over the cliff. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ayers is worth like 80 million. He's gonna run for office eventually as a southern Republican and he doesn't want to be associated with this radioactive trainwreck.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump is just mad he can't grab him by the pussy after he said no. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Surprise, the Narcissist in Chief deals with rejection poorly. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You’d have to be as dumb as trump to want to take any position in this administration at this point. You’re pretty much guaranteed to be investigated and spend your salary on legal fees trying to stay out of prison.  ~end~

> At press time, the White House was reportedly thrown into chaos after the large fern confirmed it would not accept the new job. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump: “You’ll never work in this town again!”

Ayers: “Not while you’re here. That’s the point.” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump: "Never heard of Ayers. I already fired him from the job because he's not good enough. I only work with the best."  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I don't wish Ayers success in the future because his views and agenda are quite problematic, but this was a smart move. Politicians who want a future need to distance themselves from the Trump disaster.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The Trump hire-n-fire cycle is well known now. Things are a mess, and Trump gets in his head--"This guy, this is what we need. Great guy. Genius. He's going to do great." Note the complete lack of specifics.  The new guys comes on, possibly with some ideas that Trump might be advised to take. He doesn't. He's an idiot, he doesn't read or listen, and he only follows what his "gut" tells him to do. There are some blow ups and few bad news cycles--Trump's fault, of course, but soon Trump's attention starts to fade. There's a new guy. Next thing you know, he's out the door.

Who in their right mind would sign up for that? I might also ask who in their right might would go work on Trump's re-election campaign, but that's a different post. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~  I'm guessing they never even talked to him about the job prior to his name being floated as a replacement for Kelly and that he learned he was being considered for the job the same way the rest of us learned about it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He's gonna try to fire Ayers. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Good, let the rage and hate flow through him, each ally he loses is another person that will not help him when the time will come for him to pay for his crimes.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Good luck finding a replacement for Kelly.  I can't imagine who would want the job when they see how it worked out for a fucking Army General. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Good.  Maybe he'll have a coronary. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ rumour is trump likes piss. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm sure there's a long line of suck-ups and sycophants who are after this job. Break out the mouth wash and the knee pads boys - may the best man win! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I humbly decline the position Mr. President...
OK honey let's GTFOH before this place burns to the ground... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He's a young guy, he's probably not looking for a job that lasts a bit longer. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Gotta figure the odds are good that whoever takes this job ends up in prison. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm super pissed bro.

&#x200B; ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I think Ayers had a thing with Ivanka, I really do  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Now imagine this guy being offered the job by Trump's successor, and accepting it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No no no, no no! The *Fake News media* said it was him for sure but oh no, no, no way not him, oh boy were they wrong. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ well crap, even in the cult..i would think people would be tepid on taking a job in an admin that looks like its going to have serious legal issues for the next few years. Not that it would hurt future job prospects too much, you can see that with nixon staff, but the atmosphere would be total hell to live through. Id rather be waterboarded or even back in high school. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well, at least he's not 'super dooper pissed'! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Of course. Ivanka didn't get what she wanted. Daddy gave up Kelly so Ivanka can have Ayers. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Anyone else find it hilarious that there's only one super shady picture of Ayers?

It's like his front runner was some nobody that the best they can do is a heavily cropped picture of his face through the shoulders of two other men.

I look forward to seeing the pictures they pull up of the 'over 10' other candidates. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ who would want the position? Who would want to *attempt* to constrain Trump from his tantrums and inanity, while forever being a political pariah once Orangey leaves office?

no white supremacists taking his calls today as a replacement? I hear they are very fine people ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Has this job ever been offered and rejected publicly like this before? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Anyone else think he looks like he might be Trump's bastard child? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Sean Hannity, please! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Have another one of those White House job fairs. The Chief of Staff table will have the shortest line.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's totally legal and totally cool that he turned you down, Donnie.  You are out of your fucking element. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What,,, surprised Ayers won't willingly douse himself with gasoline and set himself on fire? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ A predator like Ayers wouldn't get on a sinking ship like the Trump White House. And Prince Pence probably told him not too. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Super pissed! Super pissed! He's super pissy, yaoll."

My new favorite Rick James song.

  ~cmt~ [Trump's Wall](https://i.imgur.com/xYRSQjB.png)

&#x200B; ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Chuck and Nancy should simply ask Trump when Mexico will be sending the check so they can begin construction. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump wants to waste your money on a $25 billion dollar episode of security theater for his political benefit.

No one can support this *and* qualify as a fiscal conservative, this is the epitome of waste. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ L.A. Times Editorial Board:

>Once again Congress and the president are flirting with a government shutdown, with funding set to run out for about half of the federal bureaucracy a mere four days before Christmas. **This time the hang-up is President Trump’s demand for billions of dollars for the bigger, longer wall that he has promised to build along the nation’s southern border**.

>**Democrats are resisting the demand, and rightly so. As important as border security unquestionably is, Trump’s proposed “beautiful” wall wouldn’t meaningfully hinder illegal immigration, drug smuggling or any other problem the president has cited as a rationale.** Illegal border crossings have shrunk over the last two decades, and drugs are smuggled primarily through tunnels or legal entry points.Once again Congress and the president are flirting with a government shutdown, with funding set to run out for about half of the federal bureaucracy a mere four days before Christmas. 


>**But this debate isn’t, and never has been, about the best way to secure the border. It’s about the symbolism of the wall. To Trump, it’s the embodiment of his Fortress America approach to the rest of the world**; to the more rational among us, it’s a terrible signal that the world’s greatest superpower has a bunker mentality.

>...**[A]lthough compromise is vital to a functional democracy, lawmakers should continue to resist throwing $5 billion worth of tax dollars at what amounts to a vanity project for Trump**. What both sides should be focused on is a comprehensive overhaul of U.S. immigration law that addresses the full panoply of issues associated with decades of failed policy.

>... The president needs to recognize that and stop holding the basic functions of government hostage to his wall ambitions. If he can’t persuade lawmakers to fund the wall, he shouldn’t put a huge chunk of the federal workforce on leave (which, if history is any guide, will ultimately become a paid vacation) to try to change their minds. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Thank you! This is a monument to his insane racist megalomania. A physical symbol representing white supremacist “whites on one side, browns on the other side.” And it’ll last forever, visible to all, like his hotels. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ His failure to get Mexico to 'pay for it, 100%' is a huge failure of one of Trump's most famous campaign promises. He was constantly howling this at the top of his lungs in every one of his rallies.  His failure as the great self-proclaimed deal maker to get money from Mexico for this is a 'promise made, promise broken' ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I believe the only reason Trump wants a wall is because he believes it will "immortalize him" in history books.

The thing is, Trump is already immortalized.  He will be taught for years, decades to come in classes.  Just like I had an entire semester dedicated to Nixon/Watergate, Trump will also have his.

He will be immortalized, just not in the way he envisions. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm glad people are finally recognizing its symbolic side instead of just its physical nature.

Yes, it's supposed to be a real wall, but I'm honestly not sure that is completely the point. The point is that it symbolizes something, it symbolizes Trump's ideology and message as a whole. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Vanity project is an understatememt. It's a travesty to ethics, human life, animal life, and personal property. It's a stain in human history, like the trump admin. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ America's famine wall.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So, funny story - one of the [design requirements](https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/693488.pdf) of the wall is:

>The north side of the barrier should be pleasing in color and texture to be consistent with the surrounding area. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ After 2 long years people still don't seem to understand his motivation. He wants to do one thing - fleece the government and taxpayers while he is in office. His modus operandi is giving huge contracts to his "friends" for kick back and billing the goverment a huge amount. Just like he and his father did during his time. The only reason he is interested in ANY project is so he can get a piece of the pie. When he was running to be president, he boasted about how well his company would build the wall. He said he will build it for $4B and then in every subsequent interview the number kept going up. 
He is all about getting as much money from the goverment through his shady deals as possible. Nothing more. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ A vannity project that could dramatically endanger countless lives for no reason ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > Trump's 'beautiful wall' is a vanity

  ~cmt~ "Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ douchebag, use some of your own god damn money and build a chunk of wall in the desert to serve as your bullshit monument to your presidency. thats all that wall means to you ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He called it “His Great Wall” in a recent interview - I’m sure he’s that narcissistic and insecure that he wants something similar to China’s Great Wall, that will be named after him and remembered for a millennia ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Tear down the wall! ~end~

  ~cmt~ It’s really only a matter of time before the right wing media labels him Democrat Don and paint him as a New York liberal.

  ~cmt~ This reminds me of George W. Bush. 

Tax cuts. A Medicare prescription bill that wasn’t paid for. Rollbacks of consumer protection and financial overwatch that helped lead to the housing collapse. A war on Iraq based on lies that took US tax payer dollars and enriched Dick Cheney’s investors and coworkers. 

When 2008 hit and the economy was in the tank, suddenly Republicans had never heard of George W. Bush. Bush who? Who is this Cheney person? History starts on January 4 2009! We don’t know anything of this past!

Remember when newt Gingrich wanted to label it the Obama recession and went on about how the economy was fine until Obama got elected, republicans blamed Obama for TARP and other thing enacted before he was elected. 

And now history repeats. Come 2021 Republicans will never have heard of trump. Trump who? No history starts on January 4 2021 and that damn democrat caused this economic crash and all that money wasted!

But keep those tax cuts that mysteriously came in during our collective amnesia.

  ~cmt~ If the Republican establishment dumped Trump, it would be the death of the Republican establishment.   The base would turn on them completely and they'd all be primaried out.

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's nice that, although politically expedient, some people MIGHT be willing to stand up for sort of the right thing.

But the deep-rooted problem that got us where we are and all those who supported, elected and allowed this to happen isn't going away. And they won't suddenly think, 'golly, I sure have been narrow minded and I've learned the error of my ways.' ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Freaking unwatchable. The sequence I just dealt with:

1. Let ad play with sound off.
2. After ad, Me: toggle sound on.
3. Ad automatically replays. Me: toggle off sound.
4. After ad plays a second time, Me: toggle sound on.
5. A 38 second video? All that for 38 seconds?
6. 10 seconds into the video, the web page automatically diverts to a "Update Flash Player" site   
(I refuse to use Flash tracking/hacking software).
7. Newsweek, you lose. You've been blacklisted. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It is foolish to hang on to Pence *and* Trump. If you dump Pence now, Trump could nominate a Republican outside of this scandal that can ultimately take the job and pardon Trump. Doesn't help with state crimes but take the win.

If you dump Trump now, Pence is President, names a VP, and you're in good shape whether or not Pence ultimately goes down.

The two nightmare scenarios are: the vice presidency is vacant when both men exit OR both men are acquitted in the Senate on partisan grounds and it depresses GOP turnout in an unprecedented way. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ There are respected (by Fox viewers at least) names on FNC that are beginning to change the narrative to point negatively at Trump. It will be a slow process and there will still be some detractors, but this is only going to get worse for him, and the "bottom is falling out" scenario will be quite quick once it happens. 

Will it be enough to convict him in an impeachment? Unlikely, but the existing Republicans in the Senate will furrow their brows enough to maintain respectability with the base. 

A scenario I'm interested in: a recent report from CNN indicated that even Putin is beginning to distance himself from Trump politically. [https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/08/europe/russia-putin-trump-bromance-intl/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/08/europe/russia-putin-trump-bromance-intl/index.html)

Is there a possibility that Putin actually attempts to interfere again -- but this time, *against* Trump?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This will be great for his paranoia. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Let's be very clear here - these GOP lawmakers are considering dumping him because he's becoming a liability - *not* because they're upset or concerned about his illegal activities and destruction of institutions.  This is pure, craven self-interest.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm honestly beginning to think this is just part of their PR cycle to make themselves look as good as they can under the circumstances. They will consider, consider, consider all the way to the edge of the cliff while still jumping off from it.

It's become a habit after the midterms. Candidates have seen Trump as a liability with the general voter base, but he's still far too much of a convenient leeway into the special interests that keeps their back income trickling in to discard. So they pay the lip service while coming up with excuses to never really change course. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Sorry this isn't news, it's some guys opinion.   Yes I want Trump to go ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Too little, too late! 


The People will NOT forget how the GOP stayed behind this *obviously* crooked and toxic President until it was politically inconvenient. 

You get NO fucking credit for finally doing what you should’ve done IN THE FIRST PLACE during the primaries. I don’t care if he was appealing to the people, because he was obviously appealing to the most divisive and banal aspects of the mob and harnessing it. Politicians need to have the character to go against their constituents when they’re wrong. 


Too fucking late.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is a probe.  This is not really for us.  This is to gauge the from their base. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Tronald Dump? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Sorry, GOP, but if you weren't ready for the responsibility, you shouldn't have had unprotected Primaries.  He's your candidate and this is all part of God's plan. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >Eli Stokols—a White House reporter for The Los Angeles Times—suggested that concrete evidence of wrongdoing by Trump could make continued Republican support for the president untenable.

So what're we talking about here? When trump finally stops pretending that all this publicly available evidence of wrongdoing clears him? Who, besides trump, is telling these people there's *not* publicly available evidence of wrongdoing?  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Of course they are; he was never more than a useful idiot.  Once his approval rating reaches a certain point, the party knows that self-preservation requires selectively forgetting the past two years. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Forget Trump. 

Whoever took money from the NRA for their campaign is fucked. And I believe that includes (looks at list on clip board)...the Entire Republican Party!

This is massive. They are all fucked. ~end~

Choose your fate Republicans!  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ All you folks who think the GOP can or will be redeemed from some thus far hidden (read: non-existent) moral cause are in for a surprise. 

Sources from the internet/intelligence community/judiciary, who thus far have proven to be right all the way, are saying there's a <B> RICO CASE </B> in the works over at FBI against most if not all the GOP leadership and party structure for Russian money laundering amongst other crimes.
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Oh please. Even Lindsay “Holy Hell to Pay” Graham has transformed into a full-throated unequivocal Trump supporter, even supporting a government shutdown if Trump doesn’t get $5,000,000,000 for that stupid wall he said Mexico would pay for. Graham even started blathering about us being invaded. 

And why? Because he has a primary coming up. 

It doesn’t matter how bad the legal picture gets. **Not a single Republican will ever stand up to Donald Trump.** They tremble in fear of his tweets and his “base” showing up at primaries to vote against them. 

They will never turn on him. They will defend him to the end. They won’t hesitate to destroy trust in whatever remains of our democratic institutions to do it. 

They know how badly they’re damaging our democracy but they’re all pathetic sniveling cowards.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What good does this headline serve?

MSNBC is shooting themselves in the fucking foot by publishing this.

It only gives Trump a chance to rally his base and plan against a coup. Those Senators just barely over the fence will scurry back when he does.

Let them decide, and spend the column inches on other issues.  ~end~

  ~cmt~ Eh, I'll believe it when I see it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >even considering dumping the president to save the party

Oh, the Republican Party is beyond saving at this point. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ When the Republicans eventually turn on Trump, and it will happen, everyone needs to keep reminding how long it took for them to do so, how they obstructed the whole way,  and never let anyone forget that. They enabled this to go on for do long. They are at fault for how much harm Trump and his appointees have caused.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ **Q:** How many Republicans does it take to screw in a light bulb?

**A:** Zero. They pay an illegal immigrant well below minimum wage, lie that they did and then blame it on the Democrats. 
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why even write, much less post, articles like this?  We all KNOW that the GOP will never do this.  Not ever. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Any rat still on the ship at this point is going down. They might as well be rats on the Titanic. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'll believe it when it happens. As long as McConnell controls the Senate, I have no faith in that body. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Oh no! He has ten+ people vying to become his new chief of staff

https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1072483770819846144 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That would be hilarious, Trump would turn on them. 

Its like the Dark Knight when the mob turned to a man they didn't fully understand.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If any of them had any backbone or sense of decency and morality, they would collectively say "Okay, look - we gambled and lost. This isn't who we are. Let's try to set things are right as we can and start over again." Maybe earn some respect from the other side. Inevitably get back in power in a decade or so (since we historically have such short memories). It's just baffling that so many keep finding ways to defend such obvious fuck up-ery. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm not suprised by this. I've said ever since the election that the GOP will stay with trump until it proves not to benefit them... he's an outsider. Whenever it comes time to save thier own skin they'll start ignoring his phone calls and endorsements. When he falls They'll paint themselves as the patriots and "voices of reason" on the right saving the world from "his worst deeds"  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I wish there was a flair letting me know if this is a new development or the same couple of Republicans that have showed some level of problem with Trump. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "if there’s obvious evidence"

Uh, no. If the evidence sticks and leads to conviction is what the GOP means. 

They KNOW there is evidence. They KNOW what he is. They KNOW what he did. 

Furthermore, they are part of it. So, it doesn't mean jack shit if they decide to 'distance' themselves. Sure, you may end up in different prisons, but you all deserve to end up in the same fucking place.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well I guess they’re not really considering it _privately_ anymore ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ how about they just drop the crap and stop ruining our fucking country ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Oh good the ol' McCain playbook.  Hem and haw in public.  Do nothing.

I'm not counting on any Republicans to do any good for the country as it relates to DJT.  They have had every opportunity to.  And when impeachment comes to the Senate floor, and it will, I will be shocked if ANY Republicans vote to convict.  Even in the face of overwhelming evidence that is already in the general public.

And you can see them working their arguments into the general public now.  "If he did it it's not a big deal." Dude, that's straighte from the narcissists prayer book. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Theyre just doing a cost/benefit analysis of how much potential campaign money, and votes staying on this sinking ship will cost them.  As soon as it becomes too costly, we will hear the "Oh I had no choice but to lick the boots!  I was secretly against him all along!!" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Just to make it clear understand that this is truly what politics is in the end.

"Run with a person as long as you can to keep power and when that person is shown to be undesirable, act like you never were a fan" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ lol, you don't get to dump him, fuckers. This albatross will hang around your necks until the end of time. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Stormy Daniels hush money will seem rather tame when all of Trump’s crimes are made public. Trump has taken a Dump upon the GOP. The GOP stinks until the rot is removed. Pence is also up to his eyeballs in his lies. President Pelosi is now a possibility. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Does anyone want to place their bets?

Nothing will happen except they won't allow him to run again. They will then say something along the lines that they were also fooled and blah blah blah or something even bolder.

Zero jail time for Trump, maybe some for his kids, and everything will be swept under the rug.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Getting 18 R Senators to vote to convict after impeachment simply will never happen. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I've heard this song before.  Some of these go back to 2015 before he was even a serious candidate (but most assuredly already a Russian asset).   This "sources say" shit is just noise.

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I would love to see them try. Republicans are in damned if they do, and damned if they don't situation. They Republicans such as Flake are under extreme pressure to either go a long with the President or commit political suicide and fight their base. Even Senators such as Johnny Isakson & David Perdue don't cross Trump, both would be history in Georgia. In South Carolina Tim Scott & Lindsay Graham have figured out that their constituents are farther right than most of America, and they are lock step withe the President.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Translation: As soon as it becomes likely that the investigation can link rank and file GOP to Trump's crimes we need to cut bait. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The shares of Twitter will take a huge hit if the Donald is dumped. Might even cause twitter to collapse ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why do I have the feeling Trump’s gonna let Russian military land on our shores?  Plus he has access to the doomsday button regardless of GOP support. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ They will privately consider it but not actually do it. What alternative do they have? They've brainwashed their stupid base into thinking Trump is the best thing since sliced covfefe. Trump, last I checked, still has a near 90% approval rating among republicans. Dump trump and they can dump their chance of staying in office. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The guest almost seems biased.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump making indictments great again ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ These republican lawmakers are dead wrong.  They absolutely can stand by Trump, no matter how clear the evidence or how bad the crimes.  Their base don't care at all, they're more likely to vote out the ones who try to defend the rule of law. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Americans are dumping all Republicans. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No they won't and they are complicit in all of this stinking cesspool.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I honestly hope this is bait to get some loyalty questioning and doubling down so we all get reminded who the traitors to democracy are once the cheeto is out. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Damning comment from Christie:  “When prosecutors sound that definitive they've got more usually than just one witness.”  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Its too late ill never forget that the republican party handed our country to such an obvious conman. The fact he turned out to be a traitor as well just makes my respect for my friends who still support him dwindle further everyday.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The GOP elected officials have shielded this guy from any investigation to date. He has lied daily. He has cheated to win the Presidency. He has destroyed the norms of the Presidency. He has done his level best to politicize the rule of law. None of that has been investigated. The GOP Senators only care about pro-corporate judiciary and pro-corporate tax policies. They have been getting unlimited number of those judges confirmed. The tax-cuts financed by debt were passed without a single GOP Senator giving a pretense of care about the future. We are dealing with a disaster of a president. However, a chunk of our population will vote for white supremacists - values and laws and norms be damned.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The time for these talks was right after he was sworn into office. At this point, it will not remove the stain of supporting all his horribleness and calling people who criticize it crazy. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Great... just wait about three... more... weeks... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Sorry but I think this story is mostly just MSNBC telling us what we want to hear. 
  
Fox News might be 99% propaganda but one thing they have in common with MSNBC, CNN, etc is that their bottom is profits.
  
Now bring on the nuclear downvoting because I said something rational. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why doesn't this sub simply just allow users to make posts stating their opinion, rathering than having to find some "MSNBC guest" that supports their own view before positing it?

I mean, what's really the point of the limitation at this point? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Everyone being so cynical, but the Republicans abandoning Trump is doing the right thing. Because Republicans are sabotaging this country as much as Trump, if they decide they can't continue the sabotage, that's a win. We can still hold them accountable. We need to believe in our own agency to kick them out, and be glad if they give up. It means we're winning. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Don't let them off the hook. They've been complicit in everything so far, and the fuckers deserve to burn for it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If some influential Republican Senators get a whiff of internal polling suggesting their seat is in danger in 2020, they will play their trump card (pun intended) and turn their backs on him.

The only way they'll act is if it will cost them their jobs if they don't. Nothing else is going to move them away from him. ~end~

  ~cmt~ He doesn't understand many things...like laws, government, healthcare, words, Twitter TOS. Tariffs, Interest Rates.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He's using 'collusion' as a shield, because it lacks definition. But he knows 'conspiracy' is on the way, and that's a particularly serious form of collusion. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Alternate header: “Executive of law enforcement branch doesn’t understand laws” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >It’s not collusion. It’s really conspiracy, if we’re talking about looking at it from the legal framework, because there is no charge of collusion. But there are certainly charges of conspiracies, and conspiracies can take many different forms...there’s a separate one, which is conspiracy to defraud the United States, and that basically says that you commit a crime against the United States when you interfere with a proper functioning of the laws of the United States.  

>So I think Trump doesn’t understand that even if he didn’t know, let’s assume for a moment, every part of what was going on here: how they were going to throw the election, or when exactly that was going to happen. As long as he had some idea of the understanding of the broad purpose of what they were doing and he did something, anything material to sort of facilitate that in some way, that could put him in that conspiracy. 

> So again, we don’t know all of the facts, but I think he has a fundamental misunderstanding of the law. So, when he says no collusion, he’s actually talking about very specific conduct that may be true. That may be actually right that he didn’t have phone calls with Russians about hacking the emails and throwing the election, but that’s not what’s required under the law.

Very good explanation of the specific charges that could be brought here. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Not very legal, not very cool.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Actually, he says it because he's a liar. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "You keep saying that word. I do not think it means what you think it means." ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The reason he keeps saying it is because there's some subjectivity in 'collusion'.  It's not a crime in the books. What are crimes, and serious ones, are things like wire fraud, soliciting stolen goods from a foreign government, conspiracy against the United States, etc. and these all fall under the banner of a potential conspiracy, collusion or whatever you want to call it with Russian state actors to benefit a presidential campaign.

Collusion is just a popular shorthand we use to tie all this shit up when we talk about it. It's easier to say than rattling all those other things off when we're discussing them in context. He knows he doesn't stand a chance in court on the merits of the evidence, so his last Hail Mary rests in convincing the public with an emotional appeal. He hammers on this stupid phrase so that when Mueller's report drops and it doesn't smack him with a charge of 'collusion' verbatim he can point and go HA! VINDICATED! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump keeps saying "no collusion" because the Republican base believes the things he says.  They say collusion is not a crime because it isn't, it's a descriptor for all of the crimes they committed while conspiring with Russia to attack our country.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's not even making it to the decision making part of the brain. He's saying "no collusion" because it feels superficially bad, so he immediately rejects it. 

He just responds with a rejection or an embrace of any topic based on the initial preception feeling good or bad to him (regardless of reality). He'd respond the same whether he *understood collusion or not*, because he is reacting before that assessment even takes place. 

Just like when Chuck Schumer made fun of him today with his comment *about winning Indiana* today. Trump didn't understand the subtext, but heard *winning a state in the election*. That concept felt good so he fully embraced it despite being an insult that he didn't understand. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Nah I think he keeps saying "No collusion" because he knows that his base, which is comprised of brain dead mouth-breathers, will take anything he says as gospel. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Uhhhh this is dumb. He’s saying no collusion because he’s lying...... ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Also it is conspiracy not collusion. Collusion is a crime of fixing market prices. Which is not what Trump has done.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well to be fare Trump is immeasurably stupid so there is a lot he doesn't understand. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is the same kind of semantic gymnastics that only exist so Republicans can play this stupid word game while smirking at you as you try to explain something they already know.  Save time and donkey-punch the smirk off their face. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Even if, by some miracle, he did actually understand, he'd still be screaming no collusion. Even when the have him on video saying something, he still denies it ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I must confess I don't know the definition, but would surely find out what it meant if I were for some reason accused of it. I assume it means basically  being "in cahoots" for some illeagal or nefarious outcome. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Now he's going to have to learn a new word: synergy ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Why doesn’t he just say “No Conspracy”? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If you repeat it enough times people will believe it. Sadly, a lot of people believe him. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Also it is conspiracy not collusion. Collusion is a crime of fixing market prices. Which is not what Trump has done.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Just say he's lying. He knows working with the Russians is bad, that's why he's lying about it.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I think it all started because he is being blackmailed, but then somehow started to benefit from everything and just ran with it. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's worth noting that Trump doesn't deny Treason or Conspiracy.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I just keep thinking about the "Russia, if you're listening..." moment. I'm no lawyer, but doesn't that alone meet the criteria for conspiracy as laid out in this article? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If he ever figures it out he will say “I bet a lot of people don’t even know what collusion is” ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ By collusion he thinks we are referring to collusion with a dictionary, which he in all honestly he has never done. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ How can he have a collusion when he doesn't even drove? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He keeps saying no collusion because he is a compulsive liar. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's two syllables beyond his capability. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ he thinks they're saying collision, but he doesn't remember being in an accident. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He keeps saying "no collusion" because there is no federal crime called "collusion" that fits what he has done. He will never be charged with collusion, if he can convince his base that collusion is the charge to be worried about, and he is never charged with it, then everything is fine. No matter what other charges are filed, at least it wasn't collusion. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And because he’s a serial liar. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He uses it as a generic blanket statement, as if it wipes out all of the facts, logic and reality of the case that Mueller is still working through. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He is just lying... it’s that simple. Nothing complex. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump doesn't have the cognitive ability to understand the "ON" and "OFF" of a light switch. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It all comes down to his statement about Kavanaugh after the confirmation. "I doesn't matter. I won"

He lives in a world were the only thing that matters is winning by any means necessary. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What do you call it when the president finally understands the charges and facepalms so hard he leaves a bruise?

Collusion confusion contusion. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ "Calm down bro, it's just a deal!"

-Trump probably  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Oh, he understands. He just wants to 'officially' state there isn't any - when there clearly is.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump doesn't understand anything ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ These are sophomoric and foolish articles. Trumps keeps denying collusion, because he is guilty but has great faith in his powers of persuasion. ~end~

  ~cmt~ They're acting like they're bought.  And they are.
 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Actually, they act like Lords of the Manor under the watchful eyes of the Oligarch-Kings of our time. Not just bought, but gladly participating in renewing the Feudal States of Yesteryear. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ She is unbelievably well-spoken. Good for her. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ In response, the world leaders had this to say: 

>"Pfft. Yeah? Well, you ***are*** a children. And we have, like, lots of money. And power, and stuff. So, whatever."  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Shouldn't insult children.  

The old fuckers with the conch shell are acting like a bunch of stupid bitch ass motherfuckers. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Fucking boomers, man. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Go Greta! More children need to go on strike for the climate, imagine the economic disruption, politicians will surely pay attention then.. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Actually, I think they are behaving far worse than children ever would. Children would realize much faster than these fucks that when everything goes to shit, money is going to be 100% meaningless.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That was incredible. She's so calm yet stern. I am inspired. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Our leaders are behaving like primitive folks with scavenging/looting intentions and no sense o responsibility.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Which is why now our children are starting to behave like leaders.

&#x200B;

And sometimes they're gonna be wrong and say stupid things but don't be assholes to them.  People always complain about young people but get really mad when the young people start caring about important things.  Encourage them in getting involved in important things, and then maybe we can actually get out of the shitty patterns that we have been spiraling down in for the past however many years. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Children are more science and tech savvy. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ .... Some leaders more childish than other. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ She's getting some serious attention lately, and good for her.  The youth need to push the agenda of "the future is forever now, or never."   Meaning, if we're going to survive as a species and live in a world with biodiversity, we can't fuck around any more.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I wonder how much oil money it took for these politicians to sell their souls to the devil? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Nothing significant will be done about climate change until we start to block roads like the Extinction Rebellion protesters in London.  The oligarchs will finally pay attention when their profits are threatened by road closures and labor strikes.  We only have 12 years to act according to scientists.  This is an emergency.  We need to start organizing now. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It takes one to know one! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It sucks that she’s a kid, because that’s all the excuse people need to ignore what she has to say     Or they’ll focus on her as a teen instead of what she had to say. 

She’s right. The people clapping for her know it. They’ll still do nothing.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The teen is wrong, trump is acting like a baby https://i.imgur.com/cFQyTeJ.png ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Nayirah as-Sabah, anyone? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Where would we be without the children to guide us? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ ...children that take the marshmallow now and cant wait for the two later instead. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This little girl has more sense than most all of our world leaders.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yes, and your generations are not helping by not voting after you guys turn 18. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Lol... Joke right ? This lil girl lecturing people on climate change whist drinking two bottled waters ?? Make China and India stop producing shit they have far more people and between them make up 85% of all pollution...  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ teen naïveté and ignorance of complex climatology, as well as the global economy. ~end~

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Two years. That's all it took for the Republican party, and I'm putting it on ALL of them not just Trump, to make the US a fucking laughingstock throughout the world. Congrats GOPers. By "owning the libs" you crashed our standing in the world on all fronts and no one trusts us anymore. Well done. You must be SO proud. ~end~

Being american is worse than being a falcons fan, jesus ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ We deserve this and more.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's not funny.  Future generations sure as fuck won't find it funny.  We need to start treating this malfeasance on climate change, and addressing it, for the crime against humanity that it is.  For anyone that is even a little aware of where things stand, you know I'm not being hyperbolic here.  It is literally going to end most of civilized living as we know it on this planet - and these chucklefucks are doing incredible damage to our ability to do anything about it. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Goddamn fucking Pence sitting there like a turnip in a fruit basket. As useless and out of place as can be.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ For the umpteenth time Trump finds that this is not a small family-run New York real estate business, but he apparently is incapable or unwilling to get that. I love how he started with his condescending act toward Nancy to try and diminish her importance and power and she immediately cut him off at the knees. Welcome to the next two years, or less. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ They need every one of his meetings on TV.  Let him dig is own grave on national television.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Chuck and Nancy grabbed him by the pussy. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ We need to have these meetings weekly!

I love it! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ His base do not and will not care. They are completely indoctrinated. There is nothing he says or does that can change that. I can't possibly understand it. I've known he's a charlatan since the early 80's and my guess is that most folks here have as well. We just have to work around these people.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He's used to having 4-5 takes, prompt cards, and favorible editing. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Looks like, in the end, his tough-guy persona was nothing more than smock and mirrors! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Decorum aside, how does nobody called him out to his face for being the fucking clown that he is? All through that entire circus he couldn't even bring to bare a single argument other than some mean-nothing buzzwords: border wall, national security, government shutdown, bipartisanship. Is that really all it takes to stir up his base? Just play conservative bingo and hope nobody realizes that you have no clue what you are talking about. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm gonna set an alarm; can't wait to see how he feels about this first thing in the morning. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Sadly, pigs don't really lose mud wrestling matches. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He is one of limited game. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The funny part is that he WILL blame Schumer for the shut down.  Even though he knows there is video evidence of him saying he wouldn't.  Because he also knows how FUCKING STUPID his supporters are. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ >at his own game.

  


Trump has no game. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Beet red with anger  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Time to brew some smocking hot covfefe ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He got destroyed in front of the cameras. What an idiot. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ He obviously meant to say "So, I willn't take the mantle. I willn't be the one to shut it down. I'm notn't going to blame you for it. The last time you shut it down it didn't work. I willn't take the mantle of shutting down and I'mn't going to shut it down for border security."

I guess that's even harder to believe than "wouldn't" ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ “Blame a shutdown on the them, blame a shutdown on them, blame a shutdown on them....what happened? I blacked out” ~end~

If I clicked on a picture of Hillary Clinton I would be telling google that Hillary is a good result. Google uses that information to provide relevant results for the next search. Right now Donald is winning. No bias, just logic. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This dude would be a great VP. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This just proves it that Republicans are stuck in their own fucking bubble of reality where they think what they do is right for the rest of America when in fact its what most people don't want and makes them more and more against them when things like bad policy gets passed with a below 30% approval from the majority. So hey Republicans if you pass something with30% or below approval don't be for that policy! ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If you do unpopular shit you’re gonna be unpopular. Rocket science. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ People are dumb as rocks when it comes to technology. That was painful to watch. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ted Lieu is like the George Takei of Congress. He's the unassuming old Asian uncle who has somehow figured out social media, and his troll game is savage. The hearing was about Google, but he used it as a venue to throw  shade at Steve King. My favorite part of this whole hearing is that he brought out an aide and poster boards and everything. 

 ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Am I the only one surprised that they, or really any politician, care  about their google results? Shouldn't  they, at least publicly, be above this crap? ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ My favorite part is when he Googled Steve King and read the results right in front of Steve King.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well, nothing Lieu said was a lie. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Is that why it’s different in other search engines ?
 ~end~
