1. What side of history will congressional republicans end up on? Will they be patriots or opportunists?
  
2. What damage, economic and militarily, can our enemies inflict upon us in the interim?
  
3. What societal upheaval will occur in the middle of our country, against immigrants, minorities, and intellectuals, as a result of his presidency's downfall and death (not literal) throes? 
  
4. Will this result in national unity or further division based upon resentment and identify politics? Will our nation be stinger as a result of this democratic stress test? 
  
5. What controls and countermeasures will we install to prevent a demagogue, fascist, charlatan, or 'Manchurian' from ascending to the presidency?
  
6. What will the impacts be to the power of the executive? Will there be a pivot to a stronger parliamentarian legislature within or outside our current constitutional structure?

  ~cmt~ Wow, I'm sorry this has all been so confusing for you.  If you paid more attention and didn't listen to all the fake news, it would make complete sense.  Here, I'll make it easy for you:  We should try to be allies with Russia, but why didn't Obama stop them from doing all the awful things they did?  Can you believe the only thing Obama did was impose sanctions on them?  Trump is actually standing up to them by imposing sanctions on them!  Oh, but we don't actually have to enforce those ones.  Not to mention, it was horrible Putin invaded Ukraine and Obama practically forced him to by doing nothing.  Thankfully, Trump changed the RNC platform to water down support to Ukraine and do even less.

Putin clearly wanted Hillary to win because she'd be so friendly with Russia.  But they would declare nuclear war on us if Hillary won since she'd be too tough on Russia.  Also, we should be friendly with Russia.  There is also no reason to spend more to defend our elections because Russia didn't interfere in it.  Russia tried to help the Democrats win.  And did you see how horrible those emails they leaked of hers are?  I mean, we shouldn't investigate the Russian interference that definitely did not happen, but why hasn't the DNC turned over the servers that were hacked to be investigated?  Hillary definitely would've been weak against Russia.  Hillary would've also been unreasonably harsh on Russia.  It's great Trump won so we'll actually have someone who is tough on Russia... but that Putin's not such a bad guy, is he?

Was that so hard to understand? /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I think he meant to see "with." Trump is standing up with the Russians. He just needs to review the tape and a transcript to notice his minor error. I'm sure he'll walk it back later and everyone will forgive him. /s ~end~

It's happened several times in the past. Shit, that's exactly *how* we got the 25th Amendment and why Trump can't directly fire Mueller. The only fear is something being passed that *you* don't like.

Honestly, it's kinda hard to concentrate on the rest of the photo. I'm so mesmerized and distracted by the size of 'em.

At least when predecessors back to Kennedy went home while in office, they did so no more than a few times a year and for more than a week.

FTFY, lol. The Coal industry was a contributor to at least (that I can think of off that top of my head) Joe "I can see my self backing Trump in 2020" Manchin D, WV. But if he signed on to this Paula Gene Swearengin at least made a dent with her 23% of the primary vote on ~1.33% of his budget (he raised $7.5M and she raised $100,000).

  ~cmt~ You leftists really expect me to believe a failed casino owner would be in bed with shady mobsters from Russia (like the shady mobster who bought a house from Donald Trump for 2.5X it's estimated value) and he would use these connections along with Manafort (a lobyist known for using dodgy tactics to elect political strongmen) to collude with someone like Assange (an exiled sexual predator best known for stealing information and selectively releasing it to influence the global geopolitical climate) just so he could become president and then use the office to enrich himself (like funneling projects to his own hotels, billing copious millions of dollars for travel to his own property, and installing his closest friends, business partners and family members in government agencies they aren't qualified to run)?

Please, how does that even make sense?

While Jim Gordon is running for Mayor of Gotham the Joker secretly teams up with Scarecrow to design a version of his neurotoxin that turns people in to raging murderous lunatics and then spreads the toxin throughout parts of Gotham generating what appears to citizens to be a spreading zombie apocalypse. The citizens of Gotham watch as Batman fights tirelessly against the "zombies", attempting to capture them and separate them from the "uninfected" using non-lethal devices and help from friends. Over a matter of days the hordes grow too big. Batman and company are overwhelmed as the madness spreads with no end in sight. As the heroes begin to show their fatigue Gotham starts to panic which is when the Joker shows up with his henchmen and just starts slaughtering the hordes. The Joker pushes the nightmare he created back in to the dark while becoming supreme beast, which is when Joker, claiming the establishment has failed to keep Gotham safe, announces his bid for mayor.

Go pick up your participation trophies and head back to your safe spaces so we can \#MAGA!!!

- Tackling the threat of global warming

- Equal civil liberties for all citizens regardless of race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation

- Equal pay for men and women

- A sense of pride in our nation

- Respect for the office of the presidency

  ~cmt~ All they did was catch some low level coffee boys. Manawho? Never heard of him. Cohwhat? A big nothingburger.

Seriously, this personal vendetta against Trump is a WITCH HUNT. So what if *every single person Trump has surrounded himself with has been implicated in shady if not outright illegal business?* Why isn't Trump on trial? Why do they keep going after the coffee boys? 

Has anyone looked into Big Starbucks? They might be pulling some of those FBI puppet strings ousting all the White HOuse baristas. ^/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump never even met with Manafort,  a very minor figure in the campaign. /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well it still is a waste. It’s a witch hunt against trump and they obviously have the bad guy, Manafort. No reason to keep it going. None at all.  They only worked together for a short period of time anyways.  /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Alternate facts /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > Prosecutors alleged that by committing a new crime while on release, Manafort violated terms of his home confinement in Alexandria, Va., and they asked the judge to revoke or revise it.

This is what happens when people think they're above the law.

> Prosecutors had previously complained to the judge about Manafort’s behavior as he awaits trial. In December, they accused him of violating a court’s gag order by helping ghostwrite an op-ed piece defending his work in Ukraine for an English-language newspaper in Kiev.

I had no idea that he ghost wrote a story defending his work in Ukraine. I guess this wasn't his first time acting guilty AF.

> Shortly before Manafort was due in court Friday, Trump spoke to reporters at an impromptu appearance and said “Paul Manafort worked for me for a very short period of time.”

He was your CAMPAIGN MANAGER, and you willingly brought him into the White House even after Obama warned you about him and knowing full well he was under FBI investigation.

How many are we up to now? 19 indictments and 5 guilty pleas? This "which hunt" is sure not yielding anything and therefore must be a waste of time. /s ~end~

The founding fathers knew that at some point there would be a really wealthy president that would try to pull that stunt, and they were afraid that it would set a precedent that the next president would have to not take their salary too, even if the next guy was poor and needed it.

I know you followed that with /s but lots of people really believe that whole line.

The Confederate states came right out and said the whole thing was about slavery.  Hell, multiple states made it clear in their declaration of cessation. These documents are not even hard to find.  So, to me, it seems really hard to argue that hate plays no part in celebrating the confederacy since slavery was the core issue of the war.

**Edit:** Since my comment that I will never vote for a republican again has not been well received by all, I will expand and ask, when was the last time a republican candidate actually did something worthwhile for this country? I was raised on "traditional conservative values" and believed in them for a long time, and over the last few years, and more and more every day now, I realize that they just do not work in an actual fair and just society. I never said I would only vote democrat, only that I would never vote republican again. Maybe that will change in the future but it would take an amazing candidate who was only republican in affiliation. I will never stand for the ideals that the GOP currently parade to the American people.

  ~cmt~ > These trade war tariffs we apply are being retaliated by other countries increasing tarrifs on dairy products, so international consumption of our milk is dropping faster than a small increase in any one market can support. 

That's okay.  The US can bully Canada to take more, and let their balanced supply-and-demand managed market take the economic hit from the subsidized dumping of cheap US milk.  What are friends and allies for, but to let their domestic industries get undercut?  /s

That seems to have been the plan, but 3% of the Canadian market isn't much milk on US scale.

I just can't fathom why Trump and his so-called advisors thought they could bully another country into solving a huge problem that the US created by itself by so much subsidization.  It's like socializing agriculture.  You'd think they'd be all over cutting subsidies back for the sake of conservative principles, but agriculture always seems to be an exception when it comes to government funding (= rural votes).

Don't get me wrong.  Farming is an essential capacity to maintain, and the government should have some kind of hand in that, but there are ways to do it without dumping truckloads of taxpayer cash into it.  Ironically, the supply-managed system in Canada is one of the ways to do it.  It means higher prices overall, but stable and sustainable prices.  It's that or let the prices fluctuate like a yo-yo and hope farmers can handle the economic stress from that kind of fluctuation without having to backfill the lows with government cash. ~end~

I've been interested in that whole series of events since Nate Silver published his article about how it potentially swayed the election.

What I'm trying to ask is whether or not he would have appeared before Congress with the statement just a few days before the election if he wasn't compelled to?

It seems in the spirit of not releasing information that might interfere with an election could that have been avoided if the Republicans simply didn't ask?

"Protecting" elections by not releasing factual information about a candidate is contrary to the whole concept of being an informed voter.

The FBI was never investigation the trump administration for collusion!



Trump totally fired Comey for OTHER reasons…TBD.



Manafort wasnt given millions of dollars to support Russian interests world wide, and he certainly wasnt Trumps campaign manager.


Flynn certainly wasnt outed to the president by Salley Yates and former president obama as compromised by Russia and being complicit with Russian interests. 


And it totally didnt take Trump 18 days to FINALLY decide to fire flynn only after things were heating up in the press.

He didnt fire Salley Yates THE exact day she told him this.

Nunes didnt obstruct the house intelligence committees investigation into trump by finding ABSOLUTELY no evidence that obama wire tapped trump.

  ~cmt~ I compiled a list of of the worst offenses from that platform and take any reasonable opportunity to repost it.  Have a gander:

> > Knowledge-Based Education – **We oppose the teaching of** Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) (values
clarification), **critical thinking skills** and similar programs that are simply a relabeling of Outcome-Based
Education (OBE) (mastery learning) **which** focus on behavior modification and **have the purpose of challenging the student’s fixed beliefs** and undermining parental authority.

> - [Texas Republican Platform, 2012](http://s3.amazonaws.com/texasgop_pre/assets/original/2012Platform_Final.pdf) (pdf warning)

> There are some other seriously condemnable statements in there.  For example:

> > Classroom Discipline –We recommend that local school boards and classroom teachers be given more authority to deal with disciplinary problems. **Corporal punishment is effective and legal in Texas.**

> > Early Childhood Development – We believe that parents are best suited to train their children in their early development and oppose mandatory pre-school and Kindergarten. **We urge Congress to repeal government sponsored programs that deal with early childhood development.**

> > Sex Education – We recognize parental responsibility and authority regarding sex education. We believe that parents must be given an opportunity to review the material prior to giving their consent. **We oppose any sex education other than abstinence until marriage.**

> > Private Education – **We believe that parents and legal guardians may choose to educate their children** in private schools to include, but not limited to, home schools and parochial schools **without government interference, through definition, regulation, accreditation, licensing, or testing.** 

> > Traditional Principles in Education – **We support school subjects with emphasis on the Judeo-Christian principles upon which America was founded** and which form the basis of America’s legal, political and economic systems. We support curricula that are heavily weighted on original founding documents, including the Declaration of Independence, the US Constitution, and Founders’ writings.

> > School Health Care – **We urge legislators to prohibit reproductive health care services, including counseling, referrals, and distribution of condoms and contraception through public schools.** We support the parents’ right to choose, without penalty, which medications are administered to their minor children. **We oppose medical clinics on school property** except higher education and health care for students without parental consent.

> And all of that is just in their education section.    ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You don't see miracles as much because of how much people masturbate these days. When you orgasm you release chi-power, and if you're whacking your chi-stick multiple times a day like me, you're often running on depleted chi-power, and it takes about 85 chi points to create a miracle. Flippin' the ol man bean costs about 87 chi points, so even once a day and boom, you're fucked on the miracles front.

To replenish chi power you can either tell racist/homophobic jokes or punch someone whose had an abortion recently. Memorizing the Old Testament also helps, as does waving confederate flags and getting Proud Boy tattood on your forehead.

  ~cmt~ Important to remember what the dossier actually says about the Prague meeting 

> [REDACTED BY BUZZFEED NEWS] provided further details of these meeting/s and associated anti-CLINTON /Democratic Party operations. COHEN had been accompanied to Prague by 3 colleagues and the timing of the visit was either in the last week of August or the first week of September. One of their main Russian interlocutors was Oleg SOLODUKHIN operating under Rossotrudnichestvo cover. According to [REDACTED BY BUZZFEED NEWS] the agenda comprised questions on how deniable cash payments were to be made to hackers who had worked in Europe under Kremlin direction against the CLINTON campaign and various contingencies for covering up these operations and Moscow’s secret liaison with the TRUMP team more generally.

> [REDACTED BY THE MOSCOW PROJECT] were significant players in this operation. In Prague, COHEN agreed contingency plans for various scenarios to protect the operation, but in particular what was to be done in the event that Hillary CLINTON won the presidency. It was important in this event that all cash payments owed were made quickly and discreetly and that cyber and other operators were stood down / able to go effectively to ground to cover their traces. (We reported earlier that the involvement of political operatives Paul MANAFORT and Carter PAGE in the secret TRUMP-Kremlin liaison had been exposed in the media in the run-up to Prague and that damage limitation of these also was discussed by COHEN with the Kremlin representatives). ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Surprising that Senator Burr and the Senate Intelligence Committee has confirmed every bit of it back to August 2016.  

But, according to noted tweeters and a screenshot of Mark Levin, he's just a RINO.  And Steve Cortes just said that Comey, McCabe, Clinton, Obama, the liberal media, DOJ, and FBI all got together like the fucking Legion of Doom to take down Trump.  

I've never been so conflicted on what to believe. /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Nope.  Their have been no arrests in this totally bogus witch hunt which has no evidence.

The trial is a false flag exercise by the democrats, crooked hillary, the deep state, and the night manager of the pizzagate pizza place.

Where's the transparency in the media and the failed coverage for dozens, dozens of terrorist attacks that they didn't cover or even mention. What about Hillary Clinton's transparency with her handling of emails as Sec of State. The democrats aren't calling for investigations in to the DNC, they aren't calling for investigations in to voter fraud, which is widely known, they aren't calling for investigations in to anybody but the president and his staff. I just think that the democratic party needs to accept they lost the election, and move on with their lives by working with this administration in making America great again.

No, because we're ELECTING A PRESIDENT, not getting married.

On a side note, I think part of the reason some politicians don't want to switch systems are due to the amount of people that would be out of jobs because our current system is oversized and bloated. Not a good reason to not switch (because our system is inefficient, bloated, expensive, focused on profits over care), but I definitely think this is a consideration, sadly, for politicians in many states who's primary industry is healthcare. ~end~

  ~cmt~ This is a big part of it. It's honestly shocking that "news" programs are allowed to legally lie to the viewing public.

I didn't find out this was the case until I was an adult. It's just something a lot of people never question, because *logically* it shouldn't be allowed so we assume it isn't. I mean, this is America, not North Korea. We don't have propaganda here! /s

Of course people recognize that certain outlets are right leaning or left leaning by how they choose to report on things, and the spin of the pundits. But no one ever thinks to question the *facts* that are being reported. Far too many people think that just because they see something on a program calling itself "news" that it *must* be true.  ~end~

Democracy: working as intended!      (/s because RIP otherwise) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's really not that hard, especially in a single winner election. There are complicated counting methods depending on how you want to choose your winner/s, such as a Condorcet or Borda count to find a a candidate everyone supports or Hare/Clarke if you want to elect multiple winners who all have a decent amount of support. 

FPTP is garbage and instant runoff with ranked choice allows for minor party and independent candidates. This idea of a two round vote leads to problems such as two very similar candidates splitting the vote and spoiling each other out of the November election. Consider a four way race where a Democrat and Libertarian each get 30% and two Republicans each get 20%. Ranked choice voting can lead to one of these Republicans winning after the other is eliminated, a top two runoff will likely lead to a Libertarian win. The Republican Party would be best to get together and decide which candidate will run so that they don't compete against themselves.  ~end~

None of the matters!  

Also, Trump is a good, upstanding, family values Christian, and you can't convince me otherwise, because I don't pay attention to reality!"  

-Republicans in this country right now. 

The only reason why we're so fixated on this is because the right wing refuses to acknowledge reality, and until they do, we cannot let them pretend it doesn't matter.

  ~cmt~ This whole thing makes me feel sick.  The sports thing especially. 

I spent half of my high school life being raped and beaten by a guy who was a varsity captain.  Upstanding guy.  Ivy bound. Active in his church youth group.  Had a smile that could charm a fish out of water. 

The first time he raped me I was sick. I didn't want to have sex because I had a fever and felt terrible. He pinned me to the ground and fucked me anyways. I tried to push him off but he was so strong. I froze and just went somewhere else in my mind.  After that I lost count but I remember when he decided I didn't love him if I wouldn't do anal. Boy did that make things fun. /s

The first time he hurt me (besides rape) he shoved me into a door frame. It cracked a rib and left a massive bruise on my hip. Once he threw his phone at my head. Once he threw me down on the hood of his car so hard it knocked the wind out of me.  

Guys--I'm fairly certain he killed a kitten. He swears it was an accident, but I'm pretty sure he did it on purpose. Like the time he kicked a ball directly into my face when we'd been arguing that morning, and then said it was an accident when his friends ran up to help me. Best center forward in the region. But somehow misdirected a kick across the wrong side of the field. Right.

  ~cmt~ I had the pleasure (/s) of hearing fox try to explain away what Nunes did this morning. From memory "The democrats are so scared about the memo they are still trying to stop the release! because (read this in a highly patronizing voice) "oh noooooo Nunes changed some things in the memo" Like whats the big deal right? So infuriating.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yeah, but she's so *shrill*. /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ But it’s okay, Nunes recused himself.



Should be too obvious for this, but here it is: /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Ugh. No. *Real* leaders don't write letters. A real leader would gather a bunch of loudmouthed fans, yell and scream and use nasty names and dirty words to tell lies about him. Any grade school kid knows that's the best way to fight. Speaker Ryan bigly supports the best real leader; I'm sure he got a good laugh out of your strongly worded letter.^/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Because his farming background totally qualified him for top secret material handling /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Also, he probably made a loyalty oath to Trump. You can't just expect him to break that -- that would be wrong. /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Because he's a Kenyan, Muslim, illegitimate shadow President, obviously!

/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ But it's ignorant to call dumb people dumb /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If ur on Fox News ur a Cardinal of Conservativism and can grab pussy because we're all sinners, so don't judge least ye be judged--but fuck that Keyan Muslim, am'i'right. /s

Edit: changed it to "ur" to highlight my intentions. I don't believe these morons know the difference between "you're" and "your". ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ In all fairness all liberals are weak pussies. /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Naw, if Pakistan did this to elect a Muslim Democrat as U.S. president surely Republicans would be equally fine with it. /s  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Whoah I could never imagine /s ~end~

  ~cmt~ He wasn't given a bonus check by Citibank for securing the Sec of Treasury position under Obama, he was allowed (by Citibank) to keep his bonuses he earned during his tenure with Citi, which isn't always the case apparently if you leave mid-contract. There were no back deal awards or shady bonuses for infiltrating the administration. [Please check it.](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2013/02/jack-lews-fake-citigroup-bonus-scandal.html)

I also find it quite hilarious that you say (below) you're not trying to engage in whataboutisms when that's precisely what you've done. Interesting that it's a sensationalized overexaggeration piece you've presented rife with embellishment and a false example of conflict of interest. But conservatives just can't help but project, falsify and attempt to equivocate (by whataboutisms) everything they do with questionable ethical motivations. But nooo, the liberal media is the arm that's always overtly sensationalizing with embellishment, right? (/s at the end there just in case...) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is just another example of the media being bias towards Democrats.

/s in case it isn't obvious.   ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ that seems both fair *and* balanced.

/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This, so much this. 

A big chunk of the liberal side of reddit and, more generally, the liberal side of America, continuously act and talk like this is a fluke. This is AMERICA.

Chris Rock and Dave Chapelle on SNL after the Election said it best, "America is racist? No way, we had no idea! /s"  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I think its pretty well established that his past tweets are not critiques but rather his playbook.  He was making notes for how Obama was performing so that he could attempt to do the same.  Unfortunately he didn't record enough detail to actually replicate the actions and he's not getting the desired results.  /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It took the lives of 3000 people, but in the end justice was done: his building was the tallest, in the end, as it was meant to be. Thank you victims, your sacrifice wasn't in vain! /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ But I thought trump was going to get the Peace Prize?!?11!

  ~cmt~ Or we can just blame the guy controlling the bot maker with mind-control chemtrails

Thanks, obama

  ~cmt~ We can't amend the Constitution! Like the 2nd Amendment - they're God-given rights! It's like saying we can change the 10 Commandments!!

/s, of course ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ MAGA /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ She just doesn't understand the 4D chess he's playing. Of course he had to make overblown promises in order to get elected and then deliver lesser but still tangible "improvements." (/s)

Interesting...that's a big part of what "the Establishment" does that puts his supporters off so much. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yet another reason why Obama is the worst President in history. As hated upon as he was, he couldn't even beat Trump at this metric. /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's only nonpartisan as long as everybody has an R next to their name!

/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I'm having a hard time keeping up with all the winning /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well, it'd be fine if you liberal city dwellers just voted the right way, but you don't, so we have to disenfranchise you. 

Obligatory /s. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yeah, but he *has* to be low-energy.  Gotta guard that finite supply!

(/s.  Oh my god, /s) ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I have worked with so many baby boomers in management positions who screw their employees out of minuscule amounts of money in order to make sure they get their own bonus or larger salary. The tragic irony of this is that they then have to support their own children who need help because they are working for other baby boomer managers just like their parent/s who screw them out of every penny they can. The more I have to deal with this generation in the workforce the more I absolutely loathe them.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This.  I'm clearing $130k in a relatively cheap area of the country.  A tax break would be personally beneficial in the short-term, but any significant cut could have long-lasting, far-reaching effects to many millions of Americans.  And what about minimum wage earners?  What will tax cuts do for them?  "Oh wow thanks I get $1.86 more a week.  😐". 

I agree entirely.  Fuck these regressive ideas.  HSAs are super helpful for the elderly.  Let's cut taxes and increase spending, because QE is an easy fix right?  Why do so many people in this great nation think it's ok to screw over those that most need help?

Edit:  Let me add something else barely related.  I work with a married couple that gross well over $200k, and are hardcore Trumpers.  Remind you that this is a relatively cheap area to live.  They're the #1 couple arguing about "fucking immigrants", "welfare blacks", "lazy Millenials", etc.  When his Mom started suffering with early dementia, they pulled out all the stops to get the state to pick up the tab and throw her in a nursing home.  Even though they could easily afford it and had to bend every imaginable rule to avoid being disqualified for help.  All the while exclaiming to me they're "owed this for paying taxes".  

The fucking hypocrisy.  God forbid someone genuinely poor needed that help.  Just pull yourself up by the bootstraps. /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Because obviously he's not a *former* agent, he was the guy who set the whole thing up.

I mean, come on.  A school gets shot up, and one of the survivors' parents is from the *FBI*?  Put two and two together you clueless fuck.

/s, btw ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ All good points but I think Eric, Don Jr, and Ivanka could get involved with the inheritance issue if Melania divorces their daddy. I would venture to guess that they won’t let her get a dime easily. She’s not their mom. 

But she’s definitely waiting for him to kick the KFC Bucket. 

I wonder if all that fried chicken caused his skin to turn orange? /s but not really

Totally surprising. /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ But, but. I though conservatives are the biggest defenders of the freedom of speech. How can this be? /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Let us all remember that such facts are forbidden, and fact-thinkers should be shamed for their liberalism. 


edit: /s for the love of the whatever high atop the thing ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Concur. Stupid liberals. Always preaching about "reality" and "logic". Well listen here. I don't need any thinking to come to my collusions! There are tons of treasons why Trump is better than crooked Hillary and I'm not gonna let you guys push our precedent around anymore! He is out there making Amerika great and all you guys do is obstruct justice for the American people! 

/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Your "reality" and "logic" are really just your cult bias, the objective universe is a bad and scary place, it is much more useful for me to believe in only those things that I choose to believe in. I will redefine the word "truth" to mean "Lies that are useful" because worrying about truth upset and frustrated me. Being accountable for my own actions has triggered an existential crisis because of my poor decisions, so when others tell me I don't have to blame myself it actually did change my life. 

I went out with my new found sociopathy and started killing it in business. I found some belief system that explains that material wealth reflects well on my spiritual state, so worrying about my soul is no longer a concern. 

My personal ethic makes me not question myself, which my untreated mental illness had caused me to do too much of. 

If you question my belief system it will threaten the identity I've constructed and I'll use the finely honed mental gymnastics to do what I want to do anyways. 

so sad that /s is needed.  ~end~

  ~cmt~ It's ok we'll all have HSA accounts and tort reform and selling across state lines to save us money! /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ But it effectively kills the proposed law, because no one is going to vote for whatever his concession is, and it's an all or nothing vote. So, basically, anyone can add anything, secretly, and sabotage any bill, Because they can't vote on it like bullet points. Sneak some crazy shit in like kill all Jews and you effectively kill the bill because no one will vote yea, and no one can say "Yea here, Nay on this fucking part" because they have to vote on it as a whole package. 

Fuck that shit, unless you're being immediately transparent and can face the public for your amendment/s. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is insane. How did the Obama regime literally allow this? (EDIT: sad obligatory /s. sad!) ~end~

  ~cmt~ Here's what we need to do: 1) Arm the Teachers. 2) Put a large fence around the school grounds, maybe with barbed wire on the top, so nobody can climb over it.  3) Station two of the armed teachers at the entrance, so no unauthorized folks can just walk in.  4) Give the kids all matching uniforms. Maybe a color like bright orange, so anyone who is not a student stands out. 5) We can let the good kids leave when they turn 18, but for efficiency, we'll just keep the very poor ones and the brown ones there until they hit 80 or 90.  6) They'll have to be doing something productive while they're there, we don't want anybody freeloading. Maybe they could do assembly-line work or other simple jobs for American companies.

I've been making the same amount of money for the past 13 years. Those times are over! Times are changing, boys! My bootstraps have been pulled up long enough. Time to reap the benefits from corporations who take care of their employees, give them great and affordable healthcare and pass on any additional profits to the people who helped make those profits. No sane corporation or business pockets that money for the boys at the top. It all trickles down!

In my dictionary, the first definition under the word Trust is "Businesses."

South Carolina, Louisiana  and Mississippi are the three states which I believe have the greatest potential of black and educated white citizens unexpectedly becoming a major political force and eventually even politically dominant.  But we're talking at least a decade or two before that happens and when it becomes apparent to the Republicans in-state things will get extremely ugly.  

God knows some supporters and legislators have been trying to slow it down as much as possible using laws that target minority voters and even, in several states, college students who are not from the immediate area. ~end~

  ~cmt~ I think they would argue the threat was the letting them into our system unvetted... and that the attacks could happen at a latter point.

Anyway on Saturday the 2nd the new vetting procedures should be in now...  so no more ban needed right? /s

They argue now that Trump was using the ban as a bargaining chip to force these counties to implement better procedures.  

Of course this is not what they said 120 days ago.  Either, the narrative has changed to fit what has happened, Trump has no clue how to communicate to his supporters or both. ~end~

Edit: I really should start putting an /s on my comments. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ This is really unbelievable to me. I don't like where this is going.

It's obviously a way to hide from the general public, most of whom I'm sure would rather more easily watch a video than read snippets of info from all different news sources. 

So let's think about what comes across in video that may not always come across in text:

First of all, think about how we have to put /s on sarcastic stuff we write online. Body language, all sorts of speech patterns like long pauses and inflection, and emotions like anger and nervousness don't come across as well in writing. By banning video they are really keeping a lot from the public. This is very disturbing for me...

This is the best way to play poker (or flat out lie) ~end~

  ~cmt~ At least we don't have to deal with Clinton's pay to play politics, so refreshing... /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pay to play. 

Good thing Hillary isn't in office, she would be letting huge corporations take advantage of the American public and she would bomb Syria! /s  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Cool. cool cool cool.

So they're just paying for the laws they want?

I can't see how this could go wrong. ^/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Pretty sure Podesta's emails are the biggest story in the history of American politics.^/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Things are heating up:

> **The FBI has information that indicates associates of President Donald Trump communicated with suspected Russian operatives to possibly coordinate** the release of information damaging to Hillary Clinton's campaign, US officials told CNN.

> The FBI is now reviewing that information, which includes human intelligence, travel, business and phone records and accounts of in-person meetings, according to those U.S. officials. **The information is raising the suspicions of FBI counterintelligence investigators that the coordination may have taken place**, though officials cautioned that the information was not conclusive and that the investigation is ongoing.

I can't help but wonder: where is this new information coming from? Is somebody rolling over? Did 4chan author another dossier?

Edit: re 4chan, /s  ~end~

Haven’t you heard though? America is a republic not a democracy! Disenfranchising voters is exactly what Thomas Jefferson would have wanted ^^/s ~end~

  ~cmt~ This is what they wanted to happen. It’s such an obvious scam: you want “evidence” to prove your point but don’t have it? Just make it up! It’s easy to have bots put multiple comments in that support your viewpoint regardless of the 99.5% that are in favor of net neutrality (Unlike my uncle Jim who for some reason doesn’t mind paying to visit certain websites like cable channels). 

He’s the judge, jury, and not even elected. The politics of corporatocracy are a beautiful system.

*^I ^wish ^this ^could ^have ^an ^/s ^at ^the ^end...* ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Uh no the Democrats are the ones who wanted to get us into wars with everyone. Trump is just innocently saying the US should increase its nuke stockpile and grow the military, not that they're going to do anything

  ~cmt~ But but but- muh economy!?! Trump has boosted the economy right?? DOW 25k!!! /s

Real talk, I love how the only talking point these fools have are actually a product of Obama era regulation. Especially since essentially zero of Trumps policy changes have been enacted yet. But you cannot reason with idiots. ~end~

  ~cmt~ I expect Trump to applaud the diligence and dedication of these FBI agents.  
  
/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ and for the ability to go on about how we have the biggest and best military, and that no one can fuck with America. That's literally all Trump is constantly doing too. Apparently they're more proud that their tax dollars fund the largest military and the military industrial complex by extravagant numbers, than they would be if we could all say "my taxes insure every single person can afford healthcare" or get a good education. 

Put very simply, it seems to come from this very strange macho, tough guy attitude; because I guess empathy, caring and nurturing for your fellow countrymen is for pussies. /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ What about our brown troops?  That's a stumper... /s ~end~

  ~cmt~ He only punches down because he's always on top. /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well Obama demeaned the office first by using educated words, wearing a tan suit, and eating fancy mustard! /s  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Or you could just get a job that pays more or has better benefits. /s

Most of the labor force has relatively few options when it comes to where they work. That and drug testing tends to occur in positions where people are more working class, especially the kinds that pay a decent wage. So, in this paradigm, it is more challenging to “get away with” smoking weed and still maintain your access to some of the better opportunities. 

When a guy smuggles a bottle of pee in his asshole it’s not because he’s a stoner, it’s because he wants to protect his livelihood and standard of living he’s worked to achieve. Both legal and industrial policies around marijuana disproportionally impact the poor and working class.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yeah Trump would *never* want to do something that pisses off huge portions of America. 

/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ But but but but both parties are the same!

  ~cmt~ Well obviously Scott Pruitt is qualified to be EPA Administrator since he's suing them, so he knows how they work very well

/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Well, he doesn't read. He needs his history delivered in bullet points with "exciting graphics", ideally half a page. I'm sure the US civil war can be summarized that way.

/s for the last sentence, obviously  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Also, Rosa Parks wasn't allowed to sit in that area of the bus. I mean, we're celebrating law breakers now? We should erect a statue of Bull Connor instead.

/s obviously. Though not so obvious anymore.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ There was plenty of violence on both sides. How many did the resistance movement kill? How many innocent nazis died in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, huh? So much violence on both sides. 
Really, both sides were equally bad. ^/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ They don't.  You see, Trump is smart.  He saw how Hillary was attacked for the same scandals over and over.  People fixated over Benghazi, with years of hearings and more investigations than 9/11.  Despite the fact that they all exonerated Hillary, the damage was done.  Trump learned a vital lesson from this: never let people fixate on one thing, force them to move on so they forget.  Granted, he does this by creating scandal after scandal after scandal, but I'm certain that he has a plan to transition from scandals that are actually criminal (like everything with Russia) to things that are just in poor taste (like supporting Nazis).  By the time he is done, nobody will remember his criminal misdeeds and he can spend his final years golfing and not giving a fuck what anybody thinks.  Seventeen dimensional chess, I tell you!  /s ~end~

It’s simply not appropriate to talk so negatively about the president no matter what “stories” (confirmed facts) you hear /s ~end~

  ~cmt~ Pssh, back in my day we hit our kids when they did something wrong. What’s all this pansy “treat your kid with love and respect” shit? Your kids are supposed to fear you, and then hopefully they go on to bully a smaller, weaker child. There’s no time for this “empathy” crap! My kid’s gotta be able to shank any of the other 8 year olds if necessary. I don’t give a fuck if he’s “emotionally traumatized” by me, or whatever it was that quack doctor said. The only emotions allowed in *my* household are fear and anger. That’s how I do things.

Besides, why shouldn’t I do this? My parents did this stuff to me, and I clearly turned out *fine*.

/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The response should have been that all those republicans are RINOS and plants by Obama and the Deep State to make God-emperor Trump look bad. 

I mean it’s super obvious people. Just like how Obama was playing golf when Katrina took out the Levys in New Orleans. 

/s just in case  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yeah, well. It's a plot thats been in the work for several decades all to foil Donald Trump /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You should use /s here, doesn't matter how crazy it is. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ You don't understand. The plan from the beginning was to allow Trump to win so they could take him out and a bunch of Republicans with him. Comey's announcement gave the election to Trump and the plan is working out beautifully. When this is done the deep state will have squashed all opposition and will have full dictorial control! 

/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ > I love how Trump can hire people that have worked with Russians, have Russian oligarchs attend his inauguration, unilaterally refuse to impose Russia sanctions, have people associated with him meet with Russians in one of his hotels, accept loans from Russians, spill classified information to Russians, block the press from his meetings with Russians BUT the idea that he worked with Russians is LUDICROUS to his supporters. 

Duh, he TOLD us he doesn't know Putin! HE TOOOOLLLDD US! /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Reality is liberal partisan propaganda. /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ See the Comey letter was just a ruse to get Trump elected so they could publicly shame him with their Russia lies.

What we need are *actual leftists in government* and an end to the party advancing pro-corporate neoliberal ideology. But as soon as leftists start up attacking "Democrats" who are clearly for their donors rather than their constituents, thoughtless liberals pile on complaining about "muh purity tests." God forbid we demand politicians uphold the will of the people rather than that of whoever is bankrolling them, right? What an *awful* "purity test" /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ It's not the Republicans that are wrong.. it's all established newspapers and media, university professors, the members of the national academy of scientists, NASA, the FBI, the defense department, every govt intelligence agency.

But a Nazi driving a car into protestors protesting Nazis is not funny. 

EDIT: figured I’d skip the /s at the bottom here. I hoped you’d all know I was half joking/half serious. I’m certainly not suggesting anyone drive into a pack of Nazis nor am I advocating violence of any kind. I’m simply saying that I would not shed a single tear for one dead Nazi. I’d probably laugh a little. Some of you would too. And if you’re American born waving their symbols and spreading their fucked up ideology, fuck you and everyone who looks like you. In my opinion there’s no place for this scum anywhere on this planet. For those of you PMing me “we can’t resort to violence” - yes, I know, but how do you suggest we open up a dialogue with animals like this? Seriously. I’m all ears.

Anyway, so without Flynn there, Bannon had no job to do and so Trump removed him immediately after Flynn resigned, right?  


Oh.  Wait.  Flynn resigned what, a month and a half ago?  So can someone tell me again why Bannon was on the NSC since his supposed ONE JOB there was made irrelevant?


Oh, what's that?  It's all okay because even though Bannon was put on the NSC to monitor Flynn, he never actually *attended* a meeting, to uh, monitor.

Forget that there by definition had to have been a boy or man involved at some point. That's unimportant. The main thing here is that we have a hard time talking about sex, or thinking about the women in our lives having it, so we talk about child murder instead. It's a much safer topic. Those aren't clumps of cells - those are the evidence of the commission of another crime, on par with murder. How dare they dispose of their shame?!

  ~cmt~ Most voters have no clear understanding of how the internet works, why it works and the implications thereof.

They are great swaths of the population who are secretly - and not so secretly - frightened of technology. They see this - in their minds - as a way to control 'runaway'costs and security/privacy issues..

They are wrong of course.

Just look at most of the people in power in Washington - geezers who let their staff's handle the 'tech' stuff. Most don't even understand their own email accounts. 

I'm a geezer myself but I have no power at the federal or state level. I'm just a voter. However I do vote, and I do love technology and have an understanding of how most of it works (most of the time - at least until a Microsoft update lol /s)  

It isn't all geezers either - I've met people from their 30's on proud of saying they don't understand it, don't really care for it and only use the limited programs they need for work. 

They don't continue to learn and educate themselves as tech changes and it changes all the time - as we know. 

I'm hoping the next administration will reverse this stupidity but it remains to be seen. ~end~

Nothing to see here folks, it's all legit.  These are the type of things charities are so well known for. /s

As such Trump can never ever be guilty of doing anything, and we must disband the FBI in its entirety and outlaw all media outlets except Fox News while rounding up every person that ever worked for Obama or Hillary Clinton and arresting them.

You guys had a week to find the sharks with lasers on their heads, you may have found them and proved that it all happened, but still not good enough because I don't like it. SO CHECKMATE, 42D Checkers. Learn to play.

  ~cmt~ It's economic anxiety. It has to be that. There is no other explanation.

/s by the way ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ No, it definitely wasn't the fact that they could give 2 sh*ts about the oppression, maiming, injuring and arresting of an indigenous people that is the most discriminated minority in the country and only until someone with (whom they view) is more worth of better treatment, showed up. Definitely not that. /s

Addendum: BTW, not saying you dont agree with what im saying, just adding to the narrative :) ~end~

Oh, and there's that small matter of the thirteen year old he raped who noped out after his troglodytes started threatening her and her family.

But yeah, Hillary totally runs a child sex ring from a sex dungeon located in the basement of a pizzeria that has no basement. /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That's how devious Hillary is. She made Trump do all those things and then had the basement of the pizza place removed after her sex dungeon was discovered.

  ~cmt~ Well, Trump has had millions of people learn more about the Constitution, learn more about Contract Law, about NDAs, about the 25th Amendment, about the Espionage Act, about Facebook selling us out for $ :) /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ In all fairness that was past his bedtime.../s  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ The calm and clear head of an innocent man, right there.

/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ And it was ALL planned, prepped, and executed by Obama himself. All of it. /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ I just posted something about this, but I've finally been able to pinpoint what's been bothering me such:

Even if Trump personally had a secret direct line to Putin's bedroom, that honestly comes second to the much bigger problem. It appears as if a majority of actors in our government are no longer doing so in good faith. They are violating their oath, disregarding their obligation, betraying the People of the U.S., and "meta-gaming" in a similar way to Soccer players flopping on the ground to beg the Ref for a foul, or Pinball players tilting the table to nudge the ball in another direction. If they are no longer accountable, none of their decisions have any validity; in fact they have done nothing less than invalidating the social contract itself. We have been in a constitutional crisis for over a year now. The representative figures in our government are *not* doing their duties to protect the population. This is big, this is really big, this is the kind of thing revolutions happen over.

If this wasn't the case, Trump would never have made it even into the primaries, nevermind the GE or into the presidency. He is much more a symptom than the problem himself. Here we have a person unfit for office, yet for some reason a majority of the government are acting in bad faith in order to keep him in that position rather than upholding their oath the people of the Untied States. Even if he gets kicked out, this will not change. There needs to be a permanent solution, and it needs to be a huge upheaval that might even reequire a re-write of the constitution. 

edit: To expand a bit, I imagine I'm not the only one feeling a bit conflicted with regards to this issue, and I'd like to hear from anyone else if they also have similar feelings towards this: Even though obviously the republican party are 100000x worse the democratic party, I *do* have a bit of contempt towards Democrats. When people go off blaming the Democrats, I totally agree with the response "The Republican President is corrupt and working with a hostile foreign power and the Republican congress isn't holding him accountable, this is obviously the Democrat's fault /s". But on the other hand, I can't help but feel that they should do and should have done far far more than they have done. Now I realize its because they didn't call out this behavior as being invalid and as serious as it is.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Clearly this guy is living off of blue pills guys, or just a paid shill. 

 

The storm is [still] coming. 

Future proves past.

Linda McMahon (Small Business Ad.) 
James Mattis (DefSec)

Sonny Perdue (Agricultural Dept.) 
David Shulkin (Sec. of VA) 
Dan Coats (Nat. Intelligence Dir.) 
Andrew Puzder (Labor Sec.) 
John Kelly (Sec. of Homeland Security)
Elaine Chao (Transportation Sec.) 
Michael Flynn (National Security Advisor)

Bad: 
Ryan Zinke (Sec. of Interior)
Rex Tillerson (Sec. of State)
Rick Perry (Sec. of Energy)
Steven Mnuchin (Sec. of the Treasury)
Reince Priebus (Chief of Staff) 
Stephen Bannon (Chief Strategist)
Jeff Sessions (Attorney General) 
Betsy DeVos (Sec. of Education)
Ben Carson (Sec. of HUD) 
Scott Pruitt (EPA)

/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ So a while back someone posted in another thread that lawyering up in investigations like this doesn't often happen until a bit later in the game when it becomes clear you need one. The fact that pence, this asshole, trump, and everyone else are picking up personal lawyers left and right 6 months into the presidency is pretty telling. 

Just remember everyone, this whole story about Russia and obstruction is fake news /s ~end~

  ~cmt~ Sadly, it sounds like that because it literally is that, no /s needed.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ If his defense is "it was a joke" or something like that it's just as bad.  IMO a president shouldn't say "jokes" in regards to such important issues not just because it's u presidential, but some people can't tell the /s.

  ~cmt~ Make sure you get the long form! I hear that can take a couple months longer than the standard certificate of live birth. ^^/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Soooo assuming roughly 1:1 Republicans to Democrats based on the popular vote, 70% of voters think it is disqualifying.

  ~cmt~ This is so disgusting! For multiple reasons, too.

1) They want to take money that is needed to help provide education away from underprivileged schools. Why do that? Why take away from a school that needs that money? That's right. It's an underprivileged school so those kids won't matter when they are in the real world. /s

2) Arming teachers won't help. They are asking people who have a strong relationship with their students (whether it is good or bad) to fire a loaded weapon if the student comes in with a firearm. It seems like it could make sense, the teacher sees the kid with the gun and takes action, thus saving the lives of the other students. But it doesn't! Most teachers do not want to see a student at the end of a barrel and definitely wouldn't want to be the one to end the life!

3) This could open up more problems. If the teacher does not lock up their gun properly or does not have it attached to their person this could allow for a student to get their hands on it.

Arming teachers will not be the solution and it makes me sick that these people in government think it will. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yeah but now it's gonna be safe because teachers will automatically be good at shooting people because life is an action movie ^^/s ~end~

Exactly.  People are *already* paying for uninsured and sick people, only they're paying it to private insurance companies who inflate prices to make a profit.  I'd much rather cut the private sector out of healthcare, and instead pay a tax for universal coverage where there isn't a profit motive.

> more taxes will lead to more social benefits

We might not even need to increase taxes by much either.  If there is one legitimate talking point Republicans have, it's that there *is* government waste that can be removed.  Ultra-high military spending, unnecessary bureaucracies, tax loopholes exploited by corporations and wealthy individuals are just some of the things we can get rid of.

Kind benevolent Trump is gathering all the criminal rich people and dumb rednecks into one administration so that they can all be removed in one fel swoop. By bringing America’s corruption into the open, it can be purged! He may lose his reputation of an outstandingly moral business man, but as a true martyr he’s willing to make the sacrifice. Jesus took on our sins to cleanse us, and in the same way our merciful and benevolent president is taking upon himself America’s sins unto his proverbial cross.

  ~cmt~ But I was told white privilege didn't exist! /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ But none of the black people alive today were ever slaves, so they should just get over it and stop playing the victim/s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ (I see the /s, but I hear this statement enough I'm going to respond anyway).

White guy here (Irish/German heritage... so... translucent-American), but I don't think black people are upset **with us** because our ancestors owned slaves. They are upset with us because we've done little to nothing to remove the culture that supported slavery and discrimination. A culture that exists today and furthers the systemic racism that they face. 

Obviously, I have lived a life that doesn't know 1/20th of the problems that a black man or woman deals with. But if you recognize that the house is on fire, and do nothing to help quench the flames... then I'd be upset with you too. 

So don't hear what I'm not saying. I'm not dismissing slavery. I fully stand by the idea that slavery was and still is evil. There's no justification for it. But we can't just wash our hands of the past and ignore the situation that is presented to us in our current time. 

So if anyone ever says "I didn't own any slaves, what do you want me to do about it?" Well... I want you to help fix it. Fix What? The aftermath of slavery. The oppression of minorities by a culture that is no longer allowed to legally treat minorities as property. The cultural stereotypes of Black Americans as lazy, violent criminal welfare abusers.

How do you help fix what past Americans created? Support funding for lower income kids to change their paths in life. Work towards a Universal Basic Income or a higher minimum wage that helps the oppressed attain a standard of living comparable to your middle-class white folks. Support politicians that want to change America to be more inclusive and push policies that benefit the 99%.

Everyone needs to do their part. Help Black people get registered to vote. Their voice has been ignored for far too long. In fact, get as many people as you can ready to vote. We need to show the oligarchs that they don't own this country yet.

The amount of *domestic* surveillance and intercept was/is insane.  But now we're talking communications between a "famous rich person" who has been toying with the idea of politics for 20+ years and the fucking *Russian government*.  Surely they would not keep an ever closer eye on that kind of thing ..

Given Trump's penchant for secure communications /s and NSA's crazy level of surveillance I bet they're sitting on fucking boxes full of reams of incriminating evidence.  Probably not the videos, but definitely the blackmail.  And they have more shit on the GOP than Russia might even have.

But, like all illegally-obtained information, you can't just trot out and "hey guys check this out all this stuff!"  Its a life sentence.  Snowden tried that and now hes stuck hiding in--wait a second .. ~end~

Alternatives are a spectrum of choices, but few would work until the people of Texas and Georgia overwhelmingly side against stolen elections and are willing to do the work of ousting an politician that achieves a position of power through illegal means. 

Surely, with Google at our fingertips and the history of political figure removals around the globe at our disposal, it's not a matter of choice or method, but one of 'Will'. 

Until the 'Will' is there (to confront illegal theft of elections) for the people of Texas and Georgia, no choice or method will work however mild.
