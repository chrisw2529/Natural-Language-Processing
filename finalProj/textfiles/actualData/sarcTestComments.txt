  ~cmt~ I live in Chattanooga. I get 1000 mb/s down for $70 a month with fantastic customer service and have literally never had an issue. I don't even NEED nearly that much speed -- I got it because it's only $12 more than their 100mb package and I want to support them and also make my friends jealous. I don't think my router can even technically handle that much data. It's great.

The amount of Comcast advertising here is hysterical. I get mailers at least twice a week, billboards everywhere, they've even shot "man on the street" commercials where some douchebag picks up Uber customers and makes them stream Netflix or whatever. Having lived in Nashville and seen the fuckery Comcast pulled when Google Fiber tried to move in, I was ecstatic when I moved here and was able to stop paying them. I love throwing their crap in the trash.

As a frequent government contractor, stories like this piss me off. But, I and everyone I know and work with, work their butts off for all of our clients. If you want to stamp out corruption like this out, we need oversight and accountability, and yes, that means a large government bureaucracy (but in scope of serving 300 million Americans, it's not that big). Second, I'd say toss all the current Federal Acquisition Regulations, aka, the "FAR" and re-write the whole thing. It's a mess, and self contradictory (from what I've heard). ~end~

  ~cmt~ I love it when people who have no understanding of finance give their opinion of the stock market.

Dovish fed? Are we supposed to keep interest rates at 0% indefinitely? We had that for like 8 years which was unprecedented. We needed a chairmen who was willing to raise interest rates and Powell has done a spectacular job so far.

Deficit? Sure. Because no other president has created deficit spending (/s). I’m not a fan of deficit spending, but let’s criticize him on policies that are unique to him. 

And finally the trade war... This is the worst argument. The point of a trade war is to win a ~~pyrrhic~~ victory to stunt Chinese economic growth. Trump might tote it around as “creating jobs”, which is bad on him, but the purpose is to damage the Chinese economy, not to help the US economy.

I wish people who posted stuff like this took a look around the world. The US is the only equity market not already in a full blown bear market (although, we’re quite close). Sure, US stocks suck right now. You know where they suck even more? *Literally everywhere else.* Don’t believe me? Look up some indices (and no, this isn’t solely due to the trade war).

The president has minimal impact on the economy/stock market (different things) and the economy is actually quite impressive right now. Trump is an idiot for trying to tie his presidency to the stock market, and he was obviously an idiot to troll Obama on Twitter about this same thing happening during Obama’s presidency, but let’s criticize Trump where he deserves to be criticized (it’s not like there is an absence of these).  ~end~

  ~cmt~ After the American Founding Fathers just finished fighting a bloody war of revolution against the tyranny of the British Crown, I'm sure their very first thought was, "We need to create an unaccountable Executive for our new government who would effectively be above the law." /s

In a free society, leaders and representatives ought to come under greater scrutiny for their obedience to the law than the rest of the populace, not less. And if the Constitution does not explicitly spell out a power or protection for an official (or at least imply it implicitly), that power or protection does not exist. Our leaders do not have the authority they hold by virtue of holding powerful offices, but rather because that authority has been explicitly bestowed upon them by consent of the people through the Constitution. 

No public official, from lowly clerks to the President of the United States, ought to be above the law. ~end~

  ~cmt~ Seems like some people are missing... but then again the article does say "During the 2016 Campaign." It's like a giant spider web and these named individuals are just the closest to the middle. The whole web comes back to Trump, but somehow he didn't have anything to do with any of it.

Person A did something questionable with X, B with Y, and C with Z, and all of them worked to help Trump in some way, without any direction from Trump. Trump is such a genius it radiates to everybody around him! Everybody knows what to do for Trump, and how to do it without implicating him legally! /s

Wait, did I say implicating? I meant to say none of it was illegal! double /s

Wait, then why did we even try to hide it? Witch hunt! triple /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ But, you see, although a majority of high level people in his campaign and even members of his whole family had contact/colluded, Trump HIMSELF didn't even know about it. /s ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Yeah, the RIGHT way to do it is to hire a private investigation firm and have THEM send someone to speak with foreign agents...Apparently...Slightly /s

While not 'technically illegal', I still do have some issues with the fact that Clinton and the DNC effectively paid for Russian intelligence information related to Trump, albeit indirectly through a company that subcontracted someone to do so on their behalf.

Obviously, none of that excuses and actions taken by Trump or the GOP and is a completely separate issue, but it's an issue nonetheless. ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ Trump's campaign manager has been found guilty of laundering and evading taxes on millions of dollars he made campaigning to get a Russian puppet elected in Ukraine...  Surely that's no reason to be suspicious of his work as campaign manager!  (Do I need an /s?).  


> And all of those individuals have provided no new information that suggests a conspiracy with the Russian government to commit election fraud.   

I'd be fascinated to learn where you gained such privileged inside information...  So when these criminals have made plea deals to cooperate with the investigation, what do you think this "cooperation" entails?  Do you think Flynn's "substantial cooperation" involves fetching coffee for Mueller and his "angry Democrats" while they sit around writing up fake indictments?

Meanwhile the same people bitching about food stamps are chill with the mega wealthy and corporations getting billions of tax cuts. Even when trickle down economics has been debunked. The money we lose in tax revenue does not create enough jobs, increase in pay, or overall economic boost to justify the tremendous loss. Ryan Paul and the Republicans sold out the US to the wealthy.  ~end~ 
  ~cmt~ That's your feeble demand-side economic model.  In intellectually superior supply-side economics, you obviously increase labor based on your perceived production quotas.  Demand is pointless, the consumer is meaningless.  Consumption will happen regardless.  Labor is a waste of time and money.  They were basically robots anyway, might as well replace them with actual robots who don't complain about rights or safety standards.
